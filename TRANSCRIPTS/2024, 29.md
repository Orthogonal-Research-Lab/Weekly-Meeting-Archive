helloo how are you much better good good so hello Pocky     
0:08     
and Morgan and Dick uh I don't know if you had     
0:13     
any updates before we get started uh hey hi I do have an update okay uh     
0:21     
I'll just one second so I uh got extensions for both Pocky and mahul for     
0:28     
their project so now they're due three three weeks later or four weeks later I can't remember what the date was that I     
0:35     
confirmed I I sent a message to bpy and Mah about it so whatever that date is is     
0:40     
the correct date for submissions I think it's like about a month late or a month     
0:46     
extended and so now you know I expect that everyone     
0:51     
be on time with that uh and then that brings me to this idea of a stopping     
0:57     
point so you know you can continue a project forever I suppose and keep     
1:02     
adding things in and we don't want to do that we want to come to that's one of the reasons why they have a deadline so     
1:08     
you find a good stopping point where you can say okay that's enough work for this thing this unit and then I'm going to     
1:16     
take it and I'm going to kind of wrap things up and then maybe create     
1:21     
issues uh for later work so you know we we might say okay I've got this thing     
1:27     
built um now I'm going to maybe test it a little bit and then write up some documentation and then maybe later I can     
1:34     
do some uh you know additional work on it add some features that sort of thing     
1:41     
so we want to have a good stopping point and I think you know it's just a matter     
1:46     
of thinking about how you want to present this to as your final submission you know what what do you think will be     
1:53     
a good package what what will work as a single unit so remember you're handing     
1:58     
in this project where you have code you have     
2:04     
documentation it does something and you can demonstrate it um and you know maybe     
2:09     
not everything that you're working towards is completed but it's it's good enough so that you can submit it and     
2:16     
feel good about it and then say pre f for the future we're going to add in more features and that's that's really     
2:23     
what they want so I mean I you know we we'll talk about this more as we get closer to the     
2:29     
deadline but just to let you know that that's the kind of the way you have to think about it you can't just you know I     
2:36     
don't want people to feel like they have to like uh you know build this uh you     
2:43     
know super uh you know complete thing you know you can always find a stopping     
2:50     
point and uh you know kind of get to that point and that's what you need so     
2:57     
that's okay so that's good hello hi     
3:03     
hi so yeah uh so Pocky you wanted to give your     
3:09     
update yeah hi uh so I'll just share my screen second okay uh yeah so I like     
3:19     
added the data set to the code that I was working on and this is uh what like     
3:28     
the growing graph now looks like right so as you can see there's this node     
3:33     
which does not have a label yet so I need to like recheck why that is     
3:39     
happening I believe this is like the P0 with lineage uh P1 like from P0 we have     
3:47     
like one P1 cell right I think it's that one and it's not able to like divide     
3:53     
that one specifically so I just need to check that and like uh I also added like     
3:59     
the Vector embeddings the coordinate positions as     
4:05     
the embeddings so but I just need to like make a few more changes to like     
4:10     
back propagate the uh distance the ukian distance losses and all so I will be     
4:18     
working on that today and tomorrow uh I think it's almost complete after that     
4:24     
the graph will be able to you know learn and train on its own     
4:31     
uh I mean it's not like uh perfect like the growth might not be very accurate     
4:36     
because the data set like uh the data set is only for just one MBO right and     
4:43     
that to like I was looking at the like the last values of the division     
4:49     
in the CSV file I think it's the other one so over there as well like uh I     
4:56     
think some cells the data is missing in some cell so I was thinking of like not     
5:03     
generating it to like all the 900 cells that it will have in the end because that part might not be very accurate but     
5:09     
like stop it somewhere before that to have like sort of an idea so that like     
5:15     
the model doesn't learn some irrelevant stuff basically     
5:20     
so that's what I was planning right now but yeah like uh I was able to like     
5:26     
train it according to the data that we have now and I just need to check this P0 thing     
5:34     
and just uh the ukan distance that I was mentioning so yeah I think uh this     
5:41     
should almost be done like in a few days like two to 3 days I in my proposal I     
5:48     
had mentioned that I would be implementing the K mapper algorithm along with this because then like the at     
5:55     
one point the graph would be too large to understand anything so there I wanted to implement the algorithm to make it     
6:01     
like more informative and all that and Visually a bit clear so that's why I     
6:08     
like requested for an extension to like include that feature as well because I'm not sure like how much time that would     
6:14     
take because I'll have to put it in like different stages of growth so yeah that's what I wanted to     
6:22     
mention and uh I figured out why the environment was not working in the     
6:28     
demography repository as well so I think I'll fix that and push be able to push that in a few days as     
6:37     
well so yeah this was my update am I audible yeah yeah oh yeah     
6:46     
thank you yeah um so yeah that looks good uh looks like you've got so you     
6:51     
said that you had some problem with cell one cell dividing was it p 0 or what was     
6:57     
the yeah yeah like after P1 I think it's not able to like gather information     
7:03     
about it I think uh according to the division timings file is somewhere     
7:18     
else yeah like this uh P1 cell like uh it will like     
7:24     
divide into uh EMS and P2 cells it is not not able to recognize that for some     
7:31     
reason so I just need to check that but for ab it's working fine as of now oh     
7:39     
okay well yeah I don't know what I don't know what to say about that but yeah I think it's something with the code only     
7:45     
so I'll just check that like okay yeah sounds good     
7:53     
okay yeah so that's uh yeah thanks for the update yeah looks like you're coming along on it uh solving problems that are     
8:01     
arising and then yeah making the graphs more interpretable is good and just kind     
8:06     
of working on that that's uh so we you know we'll maybe I think that's worth     
8:12     
the extension uh we'll talk about that though as we get along and then I hope     
8:17     
to see your push uh I guess later this week yeah I made that okay sorry about     
8:24     
that uh also one more thing I think I'll have to leave early today okay because I     
8:29     
to go somewhere so I'll just like uh leave now there's no more questions     
8:35     
about the update you don't have any more questions so okay thank you all right     
8:41     
thank you so much thank you bye all right so uh Susan I didn't I     
8:48     
don't know if you had any updates from last week um just a attended     
8:55     
compel um 3D and it's a mosaic model and     
9:01     
um I guess I found out the reason why there's no exact forces stated in a lot     
9:08     
of these papers because they just do a force that approximates a force that     
9:16     
attaches one cell to another cell or that will do cell     
9:22     
sorting um so they adjust the surface tension so one cell will fit inside     
9:29     
another cell or you can call this blob a nucleus and put it inside another cell     
9:37     
um it's uh so it's sort of an approximate     
9:43     
Force so they said well you try it out in Compu cell 3D and then if you want to     
9:49     
get more elaborate or more exact you use tissue Forge okay for for more exact U     
9:57     
measurements so that's um because it takes longer to set up in tissue Forge     
10:03     
right and it's great to try out ideas and cell 3D however I'm dealing with     
10:10     
Engineers I get to do hardcore how many uh Nano Newtons is that     
10:19     
exactly or are my papers worthless like I can't do oh well it's sort of like the     
10:26     
force oh you don't likeit they PR upon that     
10:36     
yeah it was interesting and and uh I really wanted to do more     
10:43     
but just not not going to work for my project oh     
10:48     
yeah anyway it's a mosaic Mo model and they definitely can do     
10:54     
um tissues uh sorting they've got um models for     
11:02     
that and then they've got a model for making a cell that moves and you can     
11:07     
kind of put you can put a vector force on it and it'll go in a direction the direction you want it to     
11:14     
go in and then it'll divide it's quite elaborate yeah um no     
11:23     
precise forces yeah anybody explain the papers     
11:30     
and I'm going where are the nano Newtons and there are none yeah so I guess that's the long and     
11:39     
short of that one yeah it's it's interesting but I can't     
11:45     
use it so I'm going to have to not think about it until I'm     
11:51     
finished if if I ever think about it again I don't     
11:56     
know they were they were interested in this TTY that I was doing well that's good     
12:02     
told them a little bit about it yeah have they done anything like that     
12:08     
like in another tissue type or organism they've uh wanted to incorporate     
12:14     
something like a t segr into their model they they like to incorporate other things into their     
12:21     
models including the vertex model uh is a is a part of a compell 3     
12:32     
uh but I don't know how you but um a tensegrity into that like it's a 3D     
12:41     
tensional structure and you put a force on it and     
12:46     
it changes shape um so I'm not not sure how they do that     
12:57     
realistically yeah there their tissue Forge might might be able to do that is     
13:04     
they're working with um fibers     
13:10     
okay oh I see because the T the cells are just kind of like these blobs     
13:16     
they're not they don't have any uh discrete structures within them so they no they don't really have a have a     
13:24     
discrete structure and although you can kind of make have     
13:29     
one like I said you using the cell sorting idea with different surface tensions right and you can put a force     
13:37     
from one uh blob to the other but you can't say precisely what force     
13:48     
and maybe I'm giving them doing them a disservice here because I wasn't paying     
13:53     
that much attention because I had a bunch of other things going on unfortunately but     
13:59     
um yeah it's just sort of oh well we're going to make a an epithelial tissue and     
14:06     
the B there's a basement layer and it has a different surface     
14:11     
tension so it tends to hold together and then there's the base the bottom of the     
14:17     
cell and then there's the middle of the cell and the top of the cell and they all have different surface tensions and     
14:23     
then they need to to stay apart in compartments and then you can put a line     
14:29     
at the top saying oh well there's a an attachment     
14:36     
there so I I maybe should try modeling it to say how close to an actual cell     
14:45     
you can get with it I wanted to try but like I say things interfered well that     
14:51     
sounds yeah it sounds interesting yeah it's it's worth a look it's they've got so many models     
14:59     
that people use and you can put a chemical gradient in them and like I was     
15:05     
thinking for epithelial epithelial cells what you need is actin     
15:14     
masin um calcium and then ATP and then you get movement yeah you could do     
15:21     
something like that um when it runs out of out of the calcium then it quits     
15:29     
moving like you you could do that yeah it quits     
15:35     
Contracting but they were interested in in doing the um model where you contract     
15:41     
one cell and then see how its neighbors react they thought it was a good project     
15:47     
yeah so you should try it yeah yeah yeah well that sounds great thanks     
15:55     
for the update and you know I don't know maybe we'll have uh another person interested     
16:01     
in work you know working on that you TR trying to experiment with it you know     
16:07     
something beyond what you what you have time for yeah well I had one person     
16:13     
interested in it but they they just had that week and then they're going to be     
16:19     
doing a PhD and I went okay yeah good good luck with the PhD     
16:30     
anyway yeah all right well thanks yeah that was     
16:36     
a good update uh yeah we had last week we had more uh more detailed discussion     
16:41     
about compell 3D and and the workshop and so that's online those materials and     
16:48     
then you know some of the more focused things we want to do in this group you know we had it some discussion about     
16:53     
that and that's something that you know uh like I said I     
16:59     
was interested in that a long time ago but I never found a way to really     
17:04     
incorporate it in what we were doing so it'd be nice to to revisit that and get some bottles running and see what what     
17:12     
we can do okay yeah yeah that's a later date     
17:18     
project yeah yeah um hi Hussein how are     
17:26     
you wonder good Monday yeah I love Monday yeah did you     
17:34     
have any updates or yeah so um Co so I'm back from my like uh CL vacation I guess     
17:41     
um you know Ain no rest for the L because they say so um yeah so um okay so I've gone     
17:50     
through the like for me to to be part of the TR for Community I had to go through     
17:56     
this uh like introductory training Workshop thing and that's basically to so okay sorry just backing     
18:01     
backing up this is part of the breast cancer comped demography project oner as well as um I post abouted a slap     
18:09     
after this in the the work um as I've been talking about for     
18:15     
the past several months excuse me I talk about last s months and um we're using     
18:20     
toas to toas is a um for prodal     
18:25     
simulational therapy treatments so for CT images for that too and um I went through the     
18:33     
like training work part of the community everything on the same page right now it's all about really reading through     
18:38     
the documentation very very thoroughly and making sure and excuse me readie the     
18:45     
documentation very very early um and that's basically that basically is uh     
18:51     
excuse me that basically is what it is um I     
18:57     
um excuse um a lot of it is really really really     
19:03     
reviewing some of the fundamental physics involved too like the physics and chemical physics geometry ali um and     
19:11     
getting a prototype so getting proty specifically for some of the some of the     
19:17     
geometry that Z and I have been discussing with the Emil well not not and I but not everyone else involved     
19:24     
like looks like we've been talking with some other people that I don't know like l p     
19:34     
[Music]     
19:40     
um yeah so she done some some of the programming for some of the other algorithms too and um we had outlined     
19:47     
some steps um I can I can briefly copy paste it from the email the um     
19:59     
private did you all see this in the yeah yeah okay okay I was making sure     
20:05     
thought okay so yeah the breast the breast cancer     
20:12     
tumor you know we definitely want to start with very simple prototypes like want very simple squares and then um on     
20:20     
two Dimensions like with an angle range from NE 45 to 45     
20:25     
um end with a very specific very specific um very specific um you know technical     
20:34     
details so this point really I just need     
20:39     
to um produce the Boost results excuse me at this point excuse me at this point     
20:45     
I really need to Performance simulation the boss and U the documentation is it's     
20:54     
it's B com but I'm trying to trying to my way     
21:07     
okay yeah that's good     
21:13     
uh that's that's okay that's all your upate okay yeah thank you uh that     
21:20     
was uh so if you want to read I'll reading the chat which you posted so     
21:25     
people uh you can't read it uh so the rbct algorithm perhaps Marty with     
21:35     
MTI and ml imp painting algorithm so this is all for this breast cancer uh     
21:41     
physics research we're doing the Imp painting uh you're doing uh physics and     
21:48     
you're trying to do this physics simulation uh so the inpainting algorithm perhaps a step where all end     
21:56     
lines are modified by the in painting so so you know dick has been trying to develop an inpainting algorithm and you     
22:03     
know maybe some of these stock algorithms might be helpful there so like R brct and Marty and then uh     
22:12     
contrast enhancement perhaps by the this fuzzy method or prior chemical     
22:17     
enhancement or x-ray defraction CT or dual energy CT just kind of a     
22:22     
combination of things uh deconvolution due to a narrow angle range uh detection     
22:29     
of possible tumors perhaps by template matching if a tumor is detected stop and ablade it if the maximum dose has been     
22:36     
reached stop so it's like you know like some sort of search algorithm where you're searching this detection you know     
22:43     
have this detection step uh if tumor is uncertain in x-ray n plus     
22:49     
one is yeah okay yeah yeah one word got cut off     
22:56     
okay yeah so yeah that's great so oh I     
23:01     
think I think the chat the chat yeah reached its limit it's okay     
23:06     
yeah hello everyone um sorry to interrupt um     
23:12     
something's come up and I have to leave okay that's okay thanks bye     
23:19     
bye all right so yeah it looks like good work and you're so you're making good progress you're learning about this new     
23:27     
uh package that you're trying to use for this I know you've been trying to find an optimal package yeah it's it's pretty     
23:33     
straightforward like uses what's called a PCS control system so all the aspects     
23:38     
of the simulation are controlled through text based basically as long as you just download it you'll have like a specific     
23:45     
file just edit whatever you specifically want to do and Sho     
23:50     
simulations simulations and once again     
23:55     
for um so for for like simulating particles matter and stuff to um excuse     
24:04     
me so yeah um really excited to keep in     
24:09     
touch regarding like the book chapters and other papers that um we've been     
24:14     
getting together so yeah whatever um yeah just just really really     
24:21     
uh um just just just really getting back into     
24:27     
yeah yeah I think yeah the original goal was to have a series of papers in this     
24:32     
book and so yeah working out the problems for the paper of course but then also for just the technique itself     
24:40     
which might lead to some other things so Bradley can I uh yeah go ahead I can     
24:46     
sort of simplify it you know most pictures are taken by a single     
24:53     
snapshot okay and that means you predetermine     
24:58     
that there's enough light you might use a flash or something and uh and then you get one picture the general procedure     
25:07     
here is that we take a picture with a small amount of light in this case     
25:15     
X-rays and uh we make it as good as we can that's what the purpose of the in painting is and then we see if it's good     
25:22     
enough to detect a tumor okay if it is we're done if we're not we add some more     
25:30     
dose so we it it's you get to take a repeated picture with more and more dose     
25:36     
until you have a stopping point okay so that's the general method     
25:41     
then is H shoot with a bit certain amount of dose and then see what you got     
25:47     
and then if it's not good enough shoot with some more yeah okay yeah so in a sense it's a     
25:54     
very general approach to uh Imaging which as far as I know has not been     
26:00     
used uh the only thing that would be similar I can think of is The Human     
26:05     
Experience of uh dark adaptation where you're you get more and     
26:11     
more sensitive to the dark the longer you're in it oh yeah about half an hour     
26:16     
yeah okay uh so it's it's a strange way it means     
26:24     
you have to do it's image dependent addition of dose so every step along the     
26:32     
way is image dependent all right okay yeah so that's     
26:38     
it's that's the way of simplifying all this it's a shoot look not good enough     
26:44     
shoot some more that's good yeah yeah that sounds     
26:50     
yeah especially espe automating using machine     
26:57     
learning yeah     
27:02     
um you know so um you know like once again really     
27:08     
excited perhaps you just clarify who who is on board for this part because I didn't quite a I don't know let's see     
27:14     
who shows up um I'm just I'm just curious because you did mention some people'     
27:21     
not they have volunteer okay degrees or timings and whatnot     
27:42     
[Music]     
27:47     
what's the name of that channel what yes     
27:55     
room yeah yeah that's or this is     
28:06     
okay all right all right yeah that's good to the yeah I I think I think it     
28:16     
auto changes the URL whenever you put it in there oh     
28:21     
yeah yeah um all right yeah um so by the     
28:26     
way I'm really taking back like how howad class is and it really easy to use     
28:33     
I thought it be some reallyy cover you know like trash bu by academic who     
28:39     
doesn't know software but like no it's actually it's actually like actually pretty decently well put     
28:45     
together yeah yeah yeah what is the link to the     
28:55     
software what's the name of it type it is     
29:04     
you have to forgive me I I I live in a household where my family is from many different places and all     
29:11     
pronunciations so I'm always so this is uh yeah topas here you     
29:20     
sh screen yeah so this is a tool for particle simulation this is the looks like it's     
29:26     
an open source platform uh and of course you can do uh     
29:33     
extends the G uh guant for simulation tool kit to make advanced money Carlo     
29:39     
simulation of all forms of radiotherapy easier to use uh so this     
29:45     
allows you to do things with microscopy images or CT images uh and you can also do Advanced     
29:53     
physics simulations uh four dimensional uh     
29:59     
simulations and I've never heard of a parameter control system maybe I'm just     
30:05     
like yeah PCS maybe I'm just not on the loop on that but uh y     
30:12     
yep I mean you know it's like what what else can you ask for for a scientist who     
30:18     
J like like not speaking on my behalf but any scientist who really need the research and get things done but they     
30:24     
can't afford to like you know get too nitty-gritty with like low LEL languages or something complicated and they're     
30:30     
just like what if I just give you a file of the you know equations that I'm trying to solve and it's like yeah     
30:36     
that's perfect that's what makes really really useful yeah I shared a few screenshots     
30:42     
by the way in the you mind you mind about to share my screen for a second so yeah yeah let me uh unshare mine there     
30:51     
we go yeah so yeah there we go so like um during the meeting uh during the     
30:57     
meeting last mon instructions Is Us new user training which by the way I'm also glad that they're they make us go through these     
31:02     
workshops and meetings because that like really helps us make sure thatare all     
31:09     
have you know like here's an example like a PC be or mlo it differ     
31:17     
stud based off so we co things you can do and um yeah     
31:25     
just so yeah yeah looks pretty nice pretty nice     
31:32     
tool and yeah you went through some trainings on that so you're kind of up to speed on it     
31:39     
now excuse me yeah yeah I think I think that's basically all I had to share so I justed     
31:46     
to keep keeping up with um everybody getting on board with this project     
31:52     
same yeah yeah it's great well thanks thanks husin and dick for the update on     
31:58     
looking forward to seeing it uh kind of come to fruition it's good okay yeah Morgan I don't know I     
32:06     
don't if you had anything to share looks like Susan's     
32:13     
back let me share my     
32:19     
screen so yeah uh well let me get into some of the things I was going to talk about today so again this is our D graph     
32:27     
GitHub repository and we've been talking about you know the different projects     
32:33     
this summer and so this is where of course everything's being pushed so at the end of September our projects will     
32:40     
end and this will you know this will be updated to reflect the projects so uh     
32:47     
mahul has been pushing to hyper demograph this uh directory and I think     
32:53     
um uh Taki's been pushing to stage two so so she's been working on some of     
32:59     
these stages independently so the goal here is to sort of get this maybe more organized or     
33:06     
maybe even uh put together a paper based on some of this stuff that's in the     
33:12     
repository and so you know we've been working on this repository for three years now uh we started with gahong and     
33:20     
uh and wataru and longi I think longi     
33:25     
was working on this as well two years ago then we had sushan last year uh     
33:31     
hansu was also working on it and then we had this year mahul and Pocky so we've     
33:36     
got a number of developers working on daph now we need to kind of turn this into something you know that     
33:43     
approximates uh you know sort of a first draft of what we've been doing and show it to the world so that's going to be um     
33:51     
sort of a goal for finishing out the year and into the next year so that's that's uh just an     
33:59     
update on this project daph um the next thing I wanted to point     
34:05     
to was that last week we talked about uh uh sort of the physics of     
34:12     
microorganisms and the micro scale and then going into the Nano scale and Susan     
34:18     
pointed out that in I think it was in copy cell 3D you know they don't they don't really     
34:24     
account for the N nanoscale effects of very small small um you know systems so     
34:31     
if you have living systems sort of at the boundary of the Nano scale Nano scale effects see this in nanotechnology     
34:38     
too where you have nanoscale effects that are very different from uh microscale effects it's hard to model     
34:44     
those uh in in a in the you know in in the same environment uh um the um 10 segurity     
34:53     
models I'm making are also not um nanoc scale     
34:58     
yeah yeah um because there     
35:04     
um there is a nanoscale um modeling you can use in commo but it     
35:11     
doesn't uh go into truss the truss model is not connected to the     
35:18     
nanoscale model so I'm not sure their logic on that you're supposed to be able     
35:24     
to scale um trusses but that doesn't     
35:32     
work yeah yeah yeah it's starting to be Harvest     
35:39     
here very soon and they're rushing around getting everything ready yeah     
35:45     
yeah so I get um we need our truck     
35:51     
yes Susan I've got a question uh can these systems uh     
35:58     
simulate stretch activated contraction     
36:04     
um you could set up compucell 3D so that it     
36:10     
does okay because the the propagation of differentiation waves and the contraction wave we're speculating as     
36:18     
stretch activated contraction no that sounds like a good guess yeah when one     
36:24     
cell contracts it expands the neighboring cells and they     
36:29     
contract yeah well but that's just a qualitative     
36:36     
dress well it just it just seems like it is but oh well um one has to prove these     
36:43     
things yeah um obviously there's a range over which it'll work range of     
36:50     
parameters yeah it's um compell 3D is a mosaic model what they're calling a     
36:56     
mosaic or patch quilt type model and it's sort of like um the tomata so you     
37:06     
can um put rules into it oh so yes you could do     
37:11     
that okay     
37:18     
yeah that's good like said it's a very interesting program to mess around with     
37:25     
and if you don't want to get serious you go to their tissue Forge     
37:31     
model personally I'm going to have to stick with um hardcore finite element     
37:37     
analysis even if it's it isn't quite it doesn't quite work for uh 10     
37:45     
seges so I'm not sure what sort of modeling would work with 10 seies um     
37:54     
properly yeah I can I'll be reviewing the     
38:02     
math and I'll tell you about it um later     
38:07     
yeah yeah so yeah we were talking about the differences of you know different     
38:14     
systems at different scales so you have Nano skll effects that are different from say micr skill effects but you also     
38:23     
have things going out at the micro scale they you know very small scales that are different than like larger scales and     
38:30     
this brings me to this uh talking about sort of a life at Lil Reynolds numbers     
38:36     
so uh this is a classic paper from 1976 this is by em purcel this is called life     
38:43     
at low Reynolds numbers and so a Reynolds number is a way to characterize uh turbulence and flows and     
38:51     
I'll talk about Reynolds numbers in a minute but like this is basically a paper on considering life in this regime     
38:58     
of a very low Reynolds number so very briefly a low Reynolds number represents     
39:04     
sort of a laminer environment where there's no turbulence and things are very almost uh they're almost in stasis     
39:13     
with respect to flow so like you know if you're in a liquid liquid is basically     
39:19     
very laminer it's you know there's no flow there's no turbulence at all at a     
39:25     
high reyolds numbers you have a lot of turbulence so people use the Reynolds number in like uh fluid dynamics to     
39:32     
characterize the flow but but what this uh paper argues is that there's this     
39:37     
whole regime of Life very small uh organisms uh single cell organisms that     
39:44     
live in this regime and so it affects the way they behave the way they move the way you know even their evolutionary     
39:51     
constraints because if you imagine like larger marine organisms they're living at higher Reynolds numbers with they     
39:57     
have to deal with turbulence and flows and their bodies are sometimes adapted to turbulent conditions and you know so     
40:06     
you know they're uh a lot of organisms at larger scales tend to be hydrodynamic     
40:11     
and things like that so this is kind of what this this was based on a talk that was given on this regime     
40:19     
so this kind of goes through like the changes in viscosity um in in these different types     
40:26     
of environments so we have so okay in this     
40:33     
case in figure one you see an object which is moving through a fluid with velocity V it has a dimension a in     
40:40     
Stokes law the object is a sphere so you just imagine an object as a sphere but     
40:46     
here is it is anything uh nmp are the viscosity and density of the fluid ratio     
40:52     
of inertial forces which is the resistance to the flow and the viscous Force as osor and Reynolds pointed out     
40:59     
slightly less than 100 years ago is given by these set of equations where V     
41:04     
is called the kinematic viscosity and so this kind of goes through Reynolds     
41:10     
number uh and when this number is small the viscous forces dominate now there is     
41:15     
an easy way which I don't real didn't realize at first to see who should be interested in small rounds numbers so     
41:21     
the viscous forces are sort of the opposite of turbulent forces and that is     
41:26     
if the fluid has certain properties those are the forces that dominate the the organism so it's a very different     
41:33     
set of conditions that the organism is in um and so this kind of talks about     
41:41     
um uh in other words if you want to tow a submarine with a Reynolds number one     
41:47     
or strictly speaking one over 6 Pi if it's a spherical submarine to it with uh     
41:53     
10 the4 dyn so it's clear in this case you're interested in small Reynolds     
41:58     
number if you're interested in small forces in an absolute sense the only other people are interested in low     
42:04     
Reynolds number although they usual we don't have to invoke it are the geophysicists and this it talks about     
42:11     
the Earth's mantle having a viscosity of 10 to the 21st pascals uh now if you     
42:18     
work out uh this equation the fores 10 41 dyn that is more than 10 the 9th     
42:26     
times the gravitation force that half of the earth exerts over the other half so the conclusion is of course that in the     
42:33     
flow of the mantle of the earth the reyolds number is very small indeed so     
42:38     
the idea is you're moving things through a liquid if that liquid is dominated by viscous forces it's very different than     
42:45     
if you have uh turbulent forces so this is um if you go back to this image here     
42:53     
this is uh this is figure one so this is figure one where you have this inertial     
42:59     
forces over viscous forces and he's considering the fluid density over the fluid viscosity that's sort of the     
43:07     
equivalence you have a which is this parameter here so it's basically the size of the organism uh this uh this     
43:15     
velocity and then uh these these environmental parameters out here so     
43:20     
basically you the organism is of a certain size it's moving through this     
43:26     
liquid there's a c certain viscosity here and the environmental parameters determine how efficiently it can move     
43:33     
through so the shape if you have a lot of turbulence the shape has to be sort of     
43:38     
hydrodynamic if it's not if it's dominated by the viscous forces it can be any size or at least uh but it can't     
43:45     
be too big uh this is showing a swimmer at a Reynolds number of 10 to the 4th     
43:52     
this is fish is at a reyolds number of 10 to the 2 and this is a microorganism with a Reynolds number of     
43:59     
10 the4 just to give you an idea of the scale and changes in the Reynolds     
44:05     
number um and then this is of course some other equation this is the Reynolds number     
44:10     
represented um in this in this way so um     
44:16     
then then of course down here you see this uh this is a feller uh     
44:23     
bacterial uh uh bacteria bacterium with a flagellum and this is shows some of the     
44:29     
calculations for that where you have 3 10 so that's the Reynolds number here     
44:36     
just showing like some of the calculations for very small organisms and then this calculation for just kind     
44:42     
of a theoretical calculation with respect to the Earth's mantle and the     
44:47     
sort of the Reynolds numbers operating there which are much much smaller than one so just to give an example of where     
44:55     
else you see those kind of rentals numbers um then the Reynolds number article in Wikipedia so this just kind of talks     
45:03     
about uh how this is a dimensionless quantity that helps predict fluid flow     
45:08     
patterns by measuring the ratio between inertial and viscous forces so basically     
45:14     
that's the ratio that you see in the figure here and you know for very small numbers     
45:22     
where the viscous forces dominate you get this uh this different regime than     
45:28     
the inertial forces where uh or in cases where the inertial forces     
45:33     
dominate so this talks about you know the difference between laminar and turbulent flows or you know living in     
45:40     
those kinds of regimes so you can live in a lamina regime or you can live in a turbulent regime but it's a very     
45:47     
different type of life and so this is kind of the lesson of um this paper so     
45:54     
this is pel um e per cell so that's that's all I     
46:01     
want to talk about with respect to U kind of that kind of following up on     
46:07     
that point and I might also bring out up some things on the difference between     
46:12     
this Nano scale and the micro scale next week so I think that might be interesting as well to talk     
46:19     
about okay so the uh paper I wanted to talk about today was this uh paper on um     
46:26     
build building a small brain with a simple stochastic generative model so um you know there are a lot of     
46:33     
small connectomes uh and C elgans of course has a tractable small connectome C elans     
46:40     
has three a connectome with 302 neurons and you have um you know a sizable you     
46:47     
know you can actually kind of figure out what the conductivity is of that both     
46:53     
synaptic connectivity and through Gap Junctions and so we have those types of     
46:58     
uh connectomes worked out and we even know kind of how the developmental connectone works because we know kind of     
47:05     
how that is built over time in development so this is an interesting     
47:10     
system to play with because we have all the parts specified there's very little you know variation between organisms     
47:18     
within celegans and we actually have good timing information for this so we can     
47:24     
play around with this small connction and we can actually build in this case what they're doing is they're building a     
47:31     
simple stochastic stochastic generative model which means they're going to build a model that allows us to see how the     
47:39     
connectone is built over developmental time so uh I'm going to read the abstract     
47:46     
here the architectures of biological neural networks result from the developmental processes shaped by     
47:53     
genetically encoded rules biophysical constraints stochasticity and learning     
47:59     
uh so this is just kind of the whole uh you know the totality of everything that     
48:04     
contributes to the development of a a biological neural network um     
48:10     
understanding these processes is crucial for comprehending neural circuit structure and function so we have to     
48:16     
know kind of where what factors play a role when to understand how this you     
48:22     
know the the adult connectone that we see um the ability to reconstruct neural     
48:27     
circuits and even entire nervous systems at the neuron and synapse level     
48:32     
facilitates the study of the design principles of neural systems and their developmental plan so here they use the     
48:39     
developing connectum of celegans using statistical generative models based on     
48:44     
simple biological features so they use neuronal cell type neuronal birth time     
48:50     
cell body distance reciprocity and synaptic pruning so they use a number of     
48:56     
variables to you know make build this model and not only build a model of its occurrence     
49:03     
but to build a generative model which means they can generate different possibilities for this connectone and     
49:10     
how it might be wired and of course like I said the the timing of the cells is is     
49:16     
deterministic the sort of the organization of the conecto is deterministic more or less but we have     
49:23     
you know a lot of plasticity in the lural room especially with respect to synap uh     
49:30     
synapse uh you know changes in synaptic connectivity so synaptic pruning     
49:35     
synaptic uh maintenance and these types of things and so these are all things     
49:40     
that were you know are kind of not really well known and they're actually maybe not even deterministic even in C     
49:48     
Elegance uh so our models accurately predict synapse existence degree     
49:53     
profiles of individual neurons and sta ICS of small Network motifs and so this     
49:59     
is where you know we're talking about things in then and we're talking about the connecto as a network with     
50:06     
statistical properties we can look at how uh you know how many connections     
50:12     
individual neurons have to other neurons that we have uh different you     
50:18     
know patterns within the connectum uh different patterns of connectivity like     
50:23     
you know triangle motifs or uh some other you know shape that gets represented through connectivity that's     
50:30     
what they mean by motifs so there are a lot of things we can predict from the network from the network uh topology and     
50:38     
things like that importantly these models require a surprisingly small number of neuronal cell types which     
50:45     
which we infer and characterize we further show that to replicate the experimental observa developmental path     
50:52     
multiple developmental epics are necessary uh validation of our models predictions of the synaptic connections     
50:58     
using multiple reconstructions of adult worms suggests that our model identified     
51:04     
the fundamental backbone of the connectivity graph so they've been a they've basically said that they're     
51:09     
successful with respect to predicting what this developmental connectome should look like and you know the     
51:15     
different variations of it the accuracy of the generative statistical models we     
51:21     
use here offers a general framework for studying how connectomes develop and the underly principles of their     
51:28     
design so they present a novel Family of generative developmental models which     
51:36     
Ray on a simple biological and physical set of features for the study of AR of the architecture and the development of     
51:43     
connectomes um and so they chose celegans because it's the only species     
51:48     
for which multiple connectomes have been reconstructed at different developmental stages and they site reference     
51:55     
16 uh which get to in a little bit um we show that models that we learn for one     
52:01     
animal are highly accurate in predicting the detailed connectivity maps of held out parts of that connectome uh for a     
52:08     
full map of another individual so basically you can uh because it's it's very predictable you can uh take one     
52:16     
part of one organism's connectum and it predicts some other organisms connect them that's what they mean by that uh     
52:23     
but they do look at these uh you know they do still look at the level of individual synapses neuronal     
52:29     
connectivity and small Network M tees uh they characterize these     
52:35     
developmental trajectories so not only is it you know very highly regular but you can also predict these different     
52:41     
developmental trajectories as I said the synaptic connections are highly variable     
52:47     
uh given environmental constraints and individual experience of the worm or whatever so you have these developmental     
52:54     
trajectories that you can predict but of course since you have this uh framework that's highly regular you can actually     
53:01     
do this quite effectively so we further characterize the developmental trajectories our     
53:06     
models predict in their tight similarity to The observed ones so they're actually very accurate in terms of predicting     
53:14     
observed developmental trajectories our model show the connectum of seans could be constructed     
53:20     
accurately using a surprisingly small set of design rules while these models offer a general     
53:26     
framework that can be extended to other neural systems our findings already suggest that a surprisingly small number     
53:32     
of parameters govern the design of neural circuits so this is interesting that given this uh conecto you know it's     
53:40     
highly predictable in a lot of ways but it also can give you these different developmental     
53:45     
trajectories um and so but you still have this uh you know it's governed by a     
53:51     
small number of parameters really isn't governed by that many parameters uh we know that for example example that not     
53:57     
only do we have environmental variation and that can have an effect on the laral connectum but we also have uh Define     
54:05     
mutant of course where we have these known effects of genetic background and     
54:11     
so but even given all of that we only have only a few sort of parameters that need to be considered so that's always     
54:19     
good because in modeling we want to have relatively few parameters to predict things um so they build their generative     
54:27     
model here uh they kind of go through this uh process for doing this these     
54:33     
models construct neural circuits using three basic operations that are carried out iteratively over discreet time steps     
54:41     
um this is where neurons are born at specific times and locations and we have that information available in the     
54:49     
community um synapses are formed independently of one another uh with a     
54:54     
probability that depends on the types of neurons they connect to and the distance between them so we know that sort of the     
55:00     
neuron birth times from the lineage tree we know where they they're going to be     
55:06     
located we have this uh information about synapses and then you know thus the     
55:12     
probability of forming a synapse from neuron I which is uh of of type DK to     
55:19     
neuron J of type TL and a given time bin is given by this equation and where uh stkl is the     
55:29     
Baseline probability to create a synaptic connection for a neuron of type TK so basically you have these pairs of     
55:36     
neurons that are going to make some sort of synaptic connection and there's a probability attached to that there's a     
55:43     
baseline probability and then there's above chance um and so D is the distance     
55:49     
between neurons this is in space so we know the positions of the cells location we know the distance that they have to     
55:56     
have you know they have to have of course uh an axon that goes between them but then their synapses and you know the     
56:04     
question is is there's you know what what what cells are most likely to synapse with other cells are they going     
56:11     
to be close by or they going to be far apart or what's the governing principle there and then BT is a coefficient     
56:17     
controlling the distance dependence and its value is time dependent to reflect the impact of the elongation of the worm     
56:24     
during development so now do you have to worry about um this sort of axonal distance but you have to worry about     
56:31     
changes in the morphology as the worm grows so this is where the uh it's     
56:36     
actually where the uh connectum grows over time as the worm grows and you get     
56:43     
this sort of elongation Factor um individual synapses are removed via pruning with probability     
56:50     
s uh minus in a manner independent of these types of neurons involved um so so     
56:56     
then they want to study the connectum of 180 neurons this is the nerve ring which     
57:02     
is the central part of the uh connectum the detailed connection connectivity of the nerve ring has been     
57:08     
reconstructed for several individual animals and different time Pointes are in development uh our our model uses     
57:15     
binarized maps of connectivity of the nerve ring of the adult worm this is the basic the generative model uh we have     
57:22     
neuron birth synaptic formation and synaptic pruning and so we can see that we have this sort of uh we're putting     
57:30     
together these neurons as they we have formation of synapses and they have the loss of     
57:35     
synapses and so one of the points they make is a small number of infer neuronal types is sufficient for building an even     
57:42     
more accurate adult where you know we don't really need to know a lot of the neuronal types we can just kind of build     
57:48     
the connectum generative models based on a small number of inferred types of neurons recapitulate neuronal and sub     
57:54     
Network features of the measured connecton uh model and accuracies reveal     
58:00     
new design features of the adult connectone so we can actually get uh so     
58:06     
the inaccuracy of our current model in predicting triplet connectivity patterns implies that synaptic connections are     
58:12     
not independently formed so this is where you know we have these uh     
58:18     
different uh this there's a reciprocity of synaptic Connections in the experimental data and it's much larger     
58:26     
than projected by a standard Eros Renu model which is a standard Network model of     
58:31     
connectivity so we have this sort of reciprocity that's expected and when we have you know our     
58:39     
model of uh the data from cgans it exceeds that expectation so that means     
58:45     
that there's some reciprocity in the model that's or in the in the seans     
58:51     
connectum that is above chance with respect to a standard model of connectivity     
58:57     
uh so that means that we have this sort of uh maybe that there's some uh genetic     
59:03     
aspect to you know synaptic connectivity that you know isn't a     
59:09     
typical of a network model um and so yeah the inferred neuronal cell types of     
59:16     
the model of play biological interpretations uh multiple developmental epics are necessary to     
59:21     
recapitulate the measured developmental path so this this is uh given the accuracy of our generative model for the     
59:28     
adult worm we turn to study the development of the connectome using the reconstructions of the nerve ring for     
59:34     
eight different nematodes from this reference 16 given that large young Lara     
59:39     
there is only a single reconstruction available per age to learn our models and validate them we randomly split the     
59:46     
total set of potential synapses that the adult War the two has one half was used     
59:51     
as the training data and the other is the test data this is a standard technique for all developmental stages     
59:57     
we then compared the accuracy of this expected value which relies on a single set of parameters of the whole     
1:00:03     
developmental process with models that use three developmental epics to predict     
1:00:08     
the imperal empirical connected and so uh basically you have this one versus     
1:00:16     
three stage model and so um interestingly the values of     
1:00:22     
probabilities of this that the multi-ethic model assigns to individual sses are Herer than those of the single     
1:00:28     
epic model at early stages figure 60 which shows the likelihood ratio of the     
1:00:33     
models over different connectomes across development demonstrates that the multi epics model is consistently better by a     
1:00:40     
large merger in the early developmental stages th multiplicity of Developmental epics emerg as a critical component for     
1:00:48     
building the worm connecting so basically the you know if you have more developmental epics the better the model     
1:00:55     
and this of course speaks to maybe what's going on in development that uh nervous system development is divided     
1:01:03     
into different parts and that they're different uh sort of things that have to be in place before you can move on to     
1:01:09     
the next EP so there's a lot in this paper and I don't want to go through the whole thing I just wanted to point out that this is     
1:01:16     
a nice paper that kind of really kind of predicts or builds a model that predicts a lot of the experimental data and so if     
1:01:23     
we look at uh citation 16 it you'll see that uh this is the Wht Fleet paper from     
1:01:30     
2023 so this is connecton across development reveal principles of brain maturation this is in nature this was a     
1:01:37     
good data set this is actually the data set we use for a lot of the synaptic stuff here and so uh there's a lot of     
1:01:44     
stuff in this paper I'm not going to go through the whole thing but this kind of is a good new paper that came out on     
1:01:51     
this developmental connect     
1:01:58     
so it looks like uh I don't know if we have any questions about that all right well if that's all for     
1:02:05     
today thanks for attending um thank you have a good week bye
