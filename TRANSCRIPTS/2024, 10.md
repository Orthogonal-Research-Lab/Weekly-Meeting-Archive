0:01     
is just us uh for now I don't know we might have people coming in well yeah     
0:07     
thanks how are you all right how are you good good great yeah you know okay so uh     
0:13     
for maybe we should wait for other people but I did I was plans together for the open source project with to see     
0:20     
how we could move forward and how I could contribute so     
0:26     
yeah there we you people hi hello     
0:34     
hello yeah great welcome uh so yeah who's we didn't meet last week we had uh     
0:42     
well I had some things as well as other people so um there any updates from     
0:49     
people I've been reading I've been reading your paper um and um since I     
0:56     
don't know very much genetics I'm surprised that I I'm managing to read it     
1:03     
fine yeah I have some suggestions if you wanted to stay on the line till after or     
1:10     
some other time um yeah we could do that in a yeah after the Meed full meeting     
1:16     
yeah' be great yeah anyone     
1:24     
else okay I I'm going to go offline because I'm I'm eating breakfast okay     
1:31     
all right all right that's good all right so I guess Hussein wants     
1:36     
to present on his uh things or sure yeah thanks so much all right thank thanks     
1:42     
for um thanks so much yeah as as I mentioned previously I wanted to get on board with uh I'm still applying to jobs     
1:48     
receiving interviews and talking to people in places about the best things to be moving forward across positions in research Tech and software they're very     
1:54     
happy to see my contributions to open source including zorm so this is a great opportunity for me to stay busy with     
1:59     
some productive and relevant that's going to directly effect and help my career so um right getting right to     
2:06     
things uh let me see if I can find My Notes essentially I'm looking to see see     
2:13     
if I can push the open open Worm Project forward and um I have a lot of data     
2:19     
sources but I'd like to create a project or do some work on data fusion and integration I have I have a lot of data     
2:24     
sources but I'm struggling with finding out which ones might be the most most relevant I figured it' be ideal to take     
2:30     
advantage of CNN's confital confital neural networks that can be used for analyzing Imaging data for extracting     
2:36     
spatial features or recurred neural networks for capturing some poal dependencies in the sequential data I     
2:42     
had a repository together um just about some preliminary work that I've done to     
2:48     
get the project together and I can see how things     
2:54     
are so I can show you guys how things are going and uh essentially     
3:01     
um yeah so I'm looking for any sort of feedback     
3:06     
particularly with uh what I can do to push things forwards to really get things started okay all right basically     
3:12     
yeah so this is yeah this isn't necessarily a fork of openworm it's kind     
3:18     
of your own repository with things yeah yeah yeah my own repository this is not it's nothing Forks nothing okay yeah that's fine I     
3:26     
mean it's uh let me share my screen here first of all     
3:31     
okay my computer got slow when I'm Shing so I'll just do it so I have it up yeah     
3:37     
you can see it uh yeah so this is has c302 in a data open wor meta uh some     
3:45     
templat so yeah it has things in it so what do what what what's supposed to be in the repository     
3:52     
here yeah there's nothing okay well I'm still I've outlined in the read me what I'm trying to do pushing the project     
3:58     
with pushing the project forward with this project um I like to in many ways     
4:03     
be able to analyze and visualize the movements of the data and Implement some sort of machine learning algorithm some kind optimize things or create B things     
4:10     
more efficient or effective okay okay so um I figure transfer learning would be optimal for this project and right now     
4:16     
there are some there were some data sources that that Bradly put me in touch with but I'm looking for any sort of feedback right now on being able to push     
4:22     
this forward to get things together whether in the next week or the coming weeks about um you know just how I can     
4:28     
contribute to Dev War in any way possible so yeah so yeah this has uh movement     
4:36     
analysis tool so we have movement data that uh is in the we have a I don't know     
4:44     
what the status of the movement Deb is right now exactly but uh you know     
4:49     
there's that there's also data for uh embryo movement so we have a lot of     
4:54     
things that you know you can look at um looks like this is you know you want to     
5:01     
analyze and visualize movement you want to use a set of machine learning algorithms and you mentioned     
5:06     
convolutional neural networks so we do have the stuff in uh dvo learn which     
5:11     
people have been working on for a couple of years now and that includes uh things like I don't think it has a I don't     
5:18     
think we have a convolutional neural network in that collection of things but we have uh rnn's and other types of     
5:26     
things um but you know the the choice of algorithm is you know it's kind of you     
5:32     
could use a lot of different algorithms if you wanted it's not right so the best the best thing I think ref focus on is what's a current objective or current     
5:38     
goal or problem that we might be what needed to solve right now yeah okay that's best     
5:43     
yeah so I mean you know there are a lot of things that we have that uh we talk about a lot yeah I don't know what the     
5:49     
best uh problem is to tackle I mean we'll have to think about that a little bit because we could you you know we     
5:56     
we've actually we've used a lot of machine learning primary way to look at uh image     
6:01     
segmentation and then the gck project is creating graph embeddings from that like creating graphs um that was     
6:10     
a uh that was someone else's gsoft what was his name     
6:17     
uh I for his name yeah well there been a couple people who worked on it um yeah but the     
6:25     
thing we don't have there of course is movement so there's a lot of movement uh in the embryos I mean we can do     
6:32     
segmentation of static images uh we've worked a little bit on movement but it's     
6:37     
kind of elusive uh there's a lot of data on like or there a lot of data sets     
6:43     
where you could extract biological motion movements and embryos movements in organisms Bradley     
6:50     
what's what's the time resolution of the embryo movement pictures uh which ones the ones that we     
6:57     
usually use or uh I'm not sure which any of them in other words what how often do     
7:03     
they take data oh so that you could look at movements of individual SS time yeah I     
7:09     
think it's like uh millisecond resolution or something like that oh really I think so well some of the newer     
7:16     
data sets um yeah so there are a lot of cell tracking algorithms that we've also     
7:22     
looked at um and there's the if you go to the uh dvo learn um uh Channel     
7:29     
there's a D.A learn channel in addition to the D.A worm channel on the slack yeah I did look at that that and so     
7:35     
there's this link to something called the cell tracking challenge so that's something that we've used in past years     
7:42     
to and this the reason I bring this up is because it has data sets in it that are maybe useful here um and people you     
7:49     
know they want to track cells anyways they have this these data sets that they     
7:55     
use to you know track cells throughout development so you're tracking their     
8:00     
migration you're tracking their position and things like that that might be useful as well to have the link is in     
8:06     
the slack so it's it's there in yeah I'd be happy to contribute like in any way possible as I mentioned my backgrounds     
8:12     
in I have a strong background in data science software engineering even some experience in AR and VR if necessary too     
8:18     
we have to create a platform or tool to actually visualize this in 3D using spatial Computing that would be amazing     
8:23     
too um yeah so really I think the best thing especially asking you guys as sciences and academics what particularly     
8:30     
might you guys be looking for what or what might be the biggest problems or objectives to really solve right now and     
8:36     
I can see how I can adopt myself to leverage things forward like you know I keep my schedule pretty flexible I know     
8:43     
how to you know communicate needs and concerns as I need to with time and energy so happy to get on board and     
8:49     
volunteer yeah well can I suggest a problem no     
8:55     
problem yeah go ahead yeah I was saying uh the     
9:00     
we still don't have a good handle on why a particular form develops     
9:07     
which obviously is a consequence of where the cells go and the orientation     
9:13     
of cell divisions and whether or not there's anything coordinated between     
9:19     
[Music] cells I'm just taking notes right yeah     
9:24     
okay uh so that's why I was asking about the time resolution with Mill second rounds     
9:30     
resolution you should be able to get that sort of thing I don't think the cells move terribly     
9:38     
fast okay so uh the you see we we've     
9:44     
kind of broken the development into lineage trees what we called differentiation trees and in the case of     
9:51     
the neemod the two are equivalent for the most part there about 50 cells which form in     
9:59     
airs so the differentiation tree is slightly different from the each     
10:05     
tree uh but that tree in some sense is wrapped in four dimensional time yeah it     
10:12     
is yeah we don't understand any of the rules for     
10:20     
that okay yeah that be that would be interesting to investigate um I can I can follow up and do a bit of research     
10:26     
and background on this and okay if you want I can send you lots of papers on differentiation treats send as many     
10:32     
papers as possible okay uh I need your email yeah     
10:38     
no problem um see look okay     
10:43     
unfortunately when I when I'm on these jitsy and Google meets if I open up other programs my computer gets really     
10:50     
slow I'm putting it in the chat there's my email address okay I'll put in my address you can send me thanks I hope     
10:56     
that's fine with you it's just if I even if I open up Slack believe it or not the computer's got to get really small so     
11:02     
yeah there you know actually another set of problems we've had where tried to uh     
11:08     
tackle are sort of visualizations and especially spatial     
11:13     
visualizations so taking the data that we have and making nice visualizations     
11:19     
of them uh you know people have created like graphs and things like that that are you know not exactly what we'd like     
11:26     
so there's a visualization component that would be really helpful um especially like creating a pipeline     
11:32     
for you know taking some idea even not just data and     
11:38     
putting it into this four-dimensional space so like yeah and you know of     
11:44     
course you have the three dimensions but then um and am adding it over time and     
11:49     
things like that cool sounds great all right this this is great this is this is really     
11:55     
really great um yeah yeah would you agree Bradley we really don't     
12:01     
know how the differentiation Tre is wrapped in four dimensional space no we don't yeah the spatial part has always     
12:07     
been tricky because I'm not really sure that the right data sets exist even now     
12:12     
with a lot of the cell tracking people even that resolution yeah well I mean you know knowing how to organize the     
12:18     
data to do well for example you could look at the orientation can you look at the orientation of individual c     
12:26     
divisions I mean you can approximate it but that's not approximated right okay     
12:31     
so that would give you an approximate four dimensional     
12:37     
map okay okay thanks okay um so are you     
12:43     
are you aware saying that uh the most of the cell divisions in Hodes are     
12:51     
asymmetric you know what that means so as asymmetric meaning um either the     
12:57     
relationship from one side to the other does not reciprocate properly or no you get one big S and one small C yes it's     
13:04     
that simple you know you understand yeah so like like asymmetrically okay okay     
13:10     
okay okay and you get about 50 cell divisions which are symmetric yeah I     
13:18     
mean something well I mean the good the good thing is that while it may seem     
13:24     
confusing and complicated the lack of degeneracy gives you a further way of separating signal from the noise you     
13:30     
know you can the very least probe further to the data when you notice that say ah there's one big and one small one     
13:36     
and if they both rather than had they both split to the same size of cells then if you for example drew a vector     
13:45     
between the nucleus of the small cell and nucleus of the large cell that would     
13:50     
give you some directionality in space yeah yeah okay it provides for you know     
13:57     
I don't think we we don't understand that directionality at all as far as I know     
14:02     
okay okay oh look it looks like Susan is offering uh some papers as well um so okay perhaps and perhaps um     
14:10     
whatever might be relevant if anyone wants to contribute I would greatly appreciate so if you wanted to you could     
14:17     
get a list of your papers your resources and send me an email that would be nice     
14:22     
okay okay well thanks um that's all I wanted to share does anyone else have     
14:28     
any other questions or inquiries um all right well thanks guys okay like I said     
14:33     
I'm balancing like several different projects at once but I can definitely devote at the very least five to 10 hours a week on an open work project and     
14:40     
I think that's that's plenty so even working part-time open source so I I would I will just want to be clear I am     
14:47     
pretty frivolous in applying the jobs right now and if I do receive a stable secure position and it's confirmed I may     
14:53     
have to uh drop this so this is meant to be volunteering while getting some very     
14:58     
Val direct experience that I can leverage towards uh job opportunities so that's where I am right now well you've     
15:05     
achieved first a Spam job off you know how much effort they put     
15:10     
into this they literally had the URL domain like some it was Trac genomics     
15:15     
and they had a URL for like Kaye recruitment tra toomic.com they     
15:21     
they made their own domain just to scam me from the real company um yeah and     
15:27     
Kaye was a real person there but they they catfished they catfished her name of a different Kaye they were like you     
15:33     
know um yeah yeah so why would they do that     
15:38     
okay here's the here's the thing here's the thing there was one big thing they were doing which isn't necessarily a red     
15:44     
flag but could have been questionable they said they were going to send me a check to purchase equipment like a     
15:49     
laptop and a hard drive to use for the job okay and I'm guessing what they want to do was to send me a fraudulent check     
15:56     
so I'd have to send some money back and then when I go to cash and in to purchase the equipment I'm stuck with a     
16:02     
fake check and they got some money out of me that that's a typical fraudulent check scheme so whenever someone says     
16:09     
I'm going to send you a check through mail you must be certain you can trust them you must be certain that this is     
16:15     
part of the job application process okay otherwise it's a scam we get checks in the mail for our     
16:22     
grain all the time and it's in thousands of dollars happens all the time I mean I     
16:29     
I've gotten checks for freelance I've gotten checks for freelance work through the mail too but they send me a legally binding contract and i' I've spoken with     
16:36     
them through video in person so I know them as a real person you know so and if they don't uphold their end of the     
16:42     
bargain or the check is fraudulent they can be legally held accountable yes that's true ours is under contract yep y     
16:49     
so here here's the thing Susan there were two things they they send me questions through email interview no     
16:55     
phone call no video and they said they' give me the job offer like I didn't meet anyone in person now that's not that's     
17:01     
not impossible it is possible for people to extend jobs like like through email     
17:07     
alone that is possible but it's very concerning the second thing was that they they said they were going to send me a check and have me buy equipment     
17:14     
myself so I'm like oh you're not even gonna like like meet me in person or     
17:20     
call me you know that's why the best thing to always do is to call with the company to confirm you are receiving a     
17:26     
job before doing anything else okay yes thinks I want another job and maybe     
17:34     
not not after what explained forget     
17:40     
this D but you you see what I'm saying like I showed their contract to many of my colleagues they're like yeah it seems     
17:45     
like a legitimate job congratulations every nobody nobody thought it could have been a scam I had     
17:51     
to call in to confirm like my friends who are professors who are academics they were     
17:57     
like congratulations Trace jobis is a wonderful place it certainly is but not this job     
18:05     
offer yeah so always stay vigilant always stay always stay cautious no     
18:11     
matter what um yeah like when we get the grain checks we always say well you take     
18:18     
to the bank and see if it bounces then you know you've received it so yeah but     
18:23     
even then I I don't know about the law specifically but if you have a fake check and you try to cash it in they     
18:29     
could arrest you on that alone even if it wasn't your intention the best thing is to always be clear at first you know     
18:35     
like even if you say to the the banket of the police like oh but this wasn't my check someone gave it to     
18:40     
me you know you don't want to be in that position you always have to be careful first okay yeah yeah y     
18:48     
i okay well thanks guys yeah yeah yeah um I do have to hop off now um um one of     
18:56     
my other projects is asking for a phone but thank you so much for the um information and feel free to email me     
19:03     
any other further communication or any other resources papers or anything else that can help me get on board with     
19:09     
understanding the morphology the morphogenesis of the cell division process so that's a great place to start so thank you so much guys bye welcome     
19:16     
thank you thank you bye yeah so that's great um and then Susan mentioned     
19:22     
um that uh like some of the work on biophysics and mechanics in development     
19:29     
to we haven't really touched on that as much in the papers that we've done uh you know that may be something     
19:36     
for future work I don't know how well you can characterize that theoretically I guess that's something that we     
19:43     
could um you know develop some techniques around especially in     
19:48     
integrating it with the four-dimensional tree okay well this this was just um how     
19:56     
you could change morphology with uh cell shape change and so it it's I guess a     
20:03     
part of this um and they're looking at a ccle epithelia which of course a     
20:12     
favorite salamanders have so that's why I I found this     
20:21     
yesterday yeah great yeah     
20:26     
thanks so that's great uh thank you to Hussein for you know pulling together a     
20:33     
a repository you know where you can contribute some things and that's really     
20:38     
you know what openworm and even Diva worm is about is like people contributing to stuff so it looks like     
20:45     
he's actually uh you know done some sort of documentation here with installing     
20:52     
this um this this tool it's not really you know all together yet but it there     
20:58     
are different sources that are being put together so uh and then this is how you would organize a repository you put     
21:06     
together you know all the in the readme put together the file structure some things about uh details about     
21:12     
contributing and then of course the license so that's that's uh description     
21:18     
of kind of how that works so I look forward to seeing what he can do on that okay um any other comments or     
21:27     
questions before we move     
21:34     
on okay so going to get into some things today     
21:40     
um we have a couple papers on SE Alan's modeling I wanted to highlight     
21:48     
uh and uh they're like couple two papers that have come out recently uh one     
21:54     
brought to my attention by Morgan and so this is meta worm this is     
22:00     
a project I guess it's out of China and they're doing something that is sort of     
22:07     
similar to openworm but you know it it takes a number of different approaches     
22:13     
and puts them together so we had a comment in the chat oh okay uh Pocky would you like to     
22:22     
ask your questions     
22:27     
now     
22:33     
you know you can if you want to you can do it okay you can type it in the chat if you'd like to so that's fine and then     
22:40     
I can come back to it later that would work I usually read them out of the chat     
22:46     
and then answer them so that please feel free to do     
22:52     
that so this is so this is this meta worm paper um so     
22:58     
this is uh again some Chinese group I'm not familiar with their work um     
23:03     
overall uh focused on artificial intelligence and biomedical Imaging uh     
23:10     
it says meta worm and integrative datadriven model simulating seelan brain body and environment     
23:16     
interactions so they're interested in this movement uh or looking at movement I guess uh we'll see what they have to     
23:23     
say in the abstract uh so the behavior of an organism is profound influenced by the     
23:29     
complex interplay between its brain body and environment so that suggests that they're looking at uh how the worm     
23:36     
interacts with its environment and in seans that means you're interested in     
23:42     
what how the worm is moving and so existing data driven models focusing on     
23:47     
either the brain or the body environment separately which I guess means that it's focused either on the connecto or on the     
23:55     
the body um simulation so so in openworm for example we have     
24:01     
c302 which is uh focused on the connectome and we have cybernetic which     
24:08     
is focused on the biophysics of the body so there's a uh two different platforms     
24:13     
there they're not well integrated in the technical sense and so this is kind of I     
24:19     
think what they're talking about uh that those don't exist as a as a unified     
24:24     
thing a model that integrates these two components is yet to be developed here we present meta worm an integrative     
24:31     
data driven model of a widely studied organism and that's the Elegance this model consists of two submodels so     
24:38     
they're two compartments to the model the brain model and the body and environment model so you know we have an     
24:44     
openworm two separate uh programs that do this     
24:50     
c302 uh with the connecto and uh cybernetic with the uh     
24:56     
biophysics simulations what they're doing is creating a single model or a single program that has two compartments     
25:02     
that simulate these things so as a as an aside here you can have you know uh     
25:09     
models of different compartments and the idea is that the compartments simulate things sort of as a um separately you     
25:17     
know as a module and then it gets put together as the same in the same program as a single output so you might for     
25:24     
example simulate the brain or simulate the connectum have a simulation running for that and then have that connected to     
25:31     
a simulation for biophysics you're not uh you know have you don't have a single     
25:37     
sort of model that takes an input into the body and then goes into the connecto and then comes out you might do comput     
25:44     
you know like a physics simulation in one compartment uh like an interactive or a network simulation in another     
25:51     
compartment and then those two uh compartments would communicate with each other exchange data and then the output     
25:59     
would be some summary of one compartment and a summary of the other compartment     
26:04     
so you know there are ways to do this where you can get a concurrent answer if you have two models or two programs it's     
26:12     
not easy to do that you were gonna ask a question Susan sorry no okay     
26:21     
um it's okay okay yeah so uh the brain     
26:27     
model was built by multicompartment models with realistic morphology connecto and neurop population Dynamics     
26:34     
so they actually even within their uh brain model which is the connecto they had several compartments within that you     
26:41     
have a connecto and and neurop population Dynamic so each neuron you     
26:46     
know you have the connectome which is a network of of neurons those neurons then themselves are not neurons they're just     
26:53     
nodes in a network but those nodes then have uh like population Dynamics so they     
27:00     
have sort some sort of electrophys simulated electrophysiological activity     
27:05     
and you can actually take those as a whole as they do a neuroscience of population Dynamics and look at the mean     
27:13     
output of that uh so this was all based on experimental data so the model was     
27:19     
validated with experimental data simultaneously the body and environment model employed a lifelike body and a 3D     
27:26     
physical environment so this is where you have have something like uh cybernetic where you have the worm in     
27:32     
embedded in a medium that you're simulating so it could be like a gel or it could be like a liquid and you're uh     
27:39     
simulating the movement within that Medium the resistance against the body     
27:44     
and the movement of the muscles and things like that it's a very different simulation than what we have for the     
27:50     
connectum and so this allows you to uh quantify the behavior through the Clos     
27:56     
Loop interaction between two sub models meta worm Faithfully reproduces the realistic zigzag movement towards     
28:03     
attractors observed in Sea elegans so this is one of the things you find in celan's Behavior are you find these     
28:09     
stereotypical movements some of them are what they call zigzag movements which are where the the worm undulates back     
28:16     
and forth there other movements that you can produce or that the worm produces     
28:21     
that we can simulate but this is probably the easiest one so it produces this one movement um     
28:28     
notably meta worm is the first model to achieve seamless integration of detailed brain body and environment simulations     
28:36     
enabling unprecedented insights into the intricate relationships between neural structures neural activities and     
28:42     
behaviors leveraging this model we investigated the impact of neural system structure on both neural activities and     
28:50     
behaviors and so this is just uh you know it helps us understand the behavior     
28:56     
of the worm and some of the things going on that generate those     
29:01     
behaviors so this is uh you know they kind of go over some of the details of     
29:08     
these types of models they kind of site uh some of the types of data driven models that exist to simulate either the     
29:15     
brain or you know neuromechanical models for the whole organism so they have uh     
29:22     
they give examples of the mouse primary visual cortex which is Citation one the mouse Dr item which is citation 2 ratat     
29:30     
somato sensory cortex which is number three and then for the neuromechanical models which are these kind of models     
29:37     
where you're merging connecto with you know the body Dynamics we have groph and     
29:44     
rodent four and five and then I like this openworm project six aimed to     
29:51     
simulate past tense SE alans years ago despite its detailed brain model and     
29:56     
body modeled work separately so apparently seelan or apparently openworm     
30:02     
is not doing anything anymore it's not true but um you know that's that's like they kind of say there's a need for an     
30:09     
integrated model so no data driven model exists that successfully integrates     
30:14     
these elements so this is one of the things uh that they so let me let's take     
30:20     
a look at those citations to see if we can find where is this an archive this     
30:26     
is uh yeah this is is bio archive okay you can send them a     
30:31     
correction to that sentence for the final version okay yeah     
30:36     
yeah let me see if I can go down to the bottom here to find the citations I wanted to show kind of what     
30:44     
citations are on the literature for this okay so uh course one is HJ can and     
30:52     
Huxley this is uh the original paper on a biophysical neurons so or one of the     
30:58     
original papers on simulating uh biophysical neurons hkin and     
31:04     
Huxley uh and so they lay out the hjin Huxley model here which is a model of uh     
31:10     
we have a tutorial of it in open worm uh that you can do and it just demonstrates     
31:15     
kind of how Action potentials work and how ION channel Dynamics work uh the     
31:21     
second paper is nicketti which is biophysical modeling of seelan neurons that's from 2019 this this is the uh     
31:29     
single ion currents and wh cell Dynamics and AWC n and rmd and those are specific     
31:35     
neurons in the seans um connectone so people are doing like their single cell recordings     
31:42     
they're doing um you know they have we have these models these classic models that we can     
31:48     
apply uh groven Sternberg which is this uh the groven Sternberg they're they're     
31:55     
from a group at Caltech where they do a lot of simulations on Saturday we were talking about some of the stuff they've     
32:02     
done in dropa um and you know they've also done things with SE elegans so that's that's     
32:09     
they're referring to there four is of course openworm c302 paper from the     
32:15     
Royal Society issue that was put out in 2018 and then uh there you know some     
32:23     
other papers on connectomes and some other things so we have a lot of ource I     
32:28     
mean there aren't that many resources on these sort of whole organism simulations     
32:33     
but um what would be helpful here I think also would be to have a nice review of that I'm not sure if people     
32:40     
have actually done this where they look at the different ways in which you know different groups     
32:47     
have simulated this uh I know there are a number of other papers which you could     
32:52     
site that would give insights into this as well uh when uh Morgan actually     
32:59     
mentioned that they were using some sort of um model that he was interested in I     
33:05     
don't if Morgan's available to uh they're using finite element modeling     
33:11     
okay so finite element modeling for yeah just a you know it's a it's a physics     
33:19     
physics model um well not that they have     
33:26     
to yeah I I was curious how they were why they were actually using it or you     
33:32     
know like how much they were bringing in kind of soft body     
33:39     
physics in at all you know was it did you get the impression     
33:46     
that they didn't like specify why they were using a finite element model or was     
33:51     
it that they I mean it would be natural um I didn't actually sorry I I'm     
34:00     
I'm getting ready for school run here uh um what departments are they in like     
34:07     
like if they're coming you know if they're coming from mechanical     
34:13     
engineering uh then it would just be it would probably be the tool that they know you know what I mean     
34:19     
yeah like as opposed to a kind conscious decision um     
34:26     
uh but yeah but a as you know there are     
34:31     
plenty of groups that do all sorts of you know robotic movements without     
34:37     
finite El you know and yeah but I think it opens up or     
34:48     
again like you know if everything is there and available it opens up some some other things that potentially you     
34:54     
could do yeah sorry sorry not in front of my computer yeah that's     
35:01     
okay yeah that that's good the reason I ask about the finite element models is because we've talked about very early on     
35:07     
in the history of the group we talked about finite element modeling and how that might be useful in some of the     
35:14     
developmental stuff so this was uh you know back in the     
35:19     
2010s so I mean I don't know uh what you     
35:24     
know we the outcome was I guess negative in the sense of we didn't adopt that method and it does take a little bit of     
35:31     
expertise to use a fin an model I know Susan probably knows something about     
35:36     
that but uh you know but there are a lot of options for doing modeling of this     
35:41     
type yeah I'm using console and it's being a huge pain it's finite element     
35:49     
analysis suan have you used console at all for coming in announce I was on the     
35:56     
phone them drop up um but no I've not I've used I mean I've     
36:01     
used consoles like biral consoles before is that what you mean or mean the console log no no she's talking about a     
36:08     
particular finite element package no no I use that no okay well it doesn't like     
36:14     
to do slack cables and unfortunately that's what cells are all about so um     
36:21     
it's very annoying I'm going to try to correct it this week but uh it it's just not ideal     
36:29     
and also if you have something under compression it won't do um something in     
36:35     
tension and your Rod falls apart well that's fine it's a microtubule and it falls apart and it     
36:42     
re rebuilds itself and that's great     
36:48     
but uh the uh comso package just says it's an error in your building track     
36:56     
it's not a building it's a cell I'm having some difficulty with it     
37:01     
because it's too too restricted yeah yeah yeah I mean     
37:07     
I'm happy to look into that too if you want to email me your concerns too yeah     
37:13     
yeah well I'm going yeah I should list them because I need to hand hand something in no problem and so yeah so I     
37:21     
could send you the the list of problems you it sure my email is in the is in the     
37:26     
chat so go ahead and okay right yeah here yeah there we go it's     
37:34     
it's the S husin there that yeah so yeah that that brings up also     
37:40     
that you know we've we've there are actually other packages that explicitly model soft body Dynamics so uh if you     
37:48     
know of anything that explicitly models um t segres let me know um the one that     
37:56     
was available online is not really available it seems to be an older package using     
38:02     
Java and it's not it doesn't want to work yeah I can't download it I can't     
38:09     
use it online I can't download it I was going to use mat lab um and apparently     
38:17     
there's something called grasshopper that actually um people have     
38:22     
used to to make um uh 10 seg gry models but um it's it     
38:32     
looks like uh Sim Link in that lab but anyway yeah that's about all I know yeah     
38:39     
okay okay no um yeah it's um one thing I've learned recently especially since I     
38:45     
started dipping into like more General legitimate software engineering is how much science and research is really held     
38:53     
back by these sorts of things that we don't have enough good soft Engineers who know how to build software I know especially when I worked in bi     
38:59     
informatics like you know it was such a such such a like     
39:05     
a I don't know like a like a I don't want to say a disaster of a discipline but like you know just so many things     
39:11     
that did not depend on the people with phds in biology but people with you know software engineering experience to     
39:18     
figure out so you know yeah well yeah that's what this is yep y it's causing     
39:24     
me a lot of problems including making my PhD into a master's     
39:31     
apparently because I'm not making enough progress don't have enough time I said     
39:37     
but it's multi-disciplined doesn't matter is it multidisciplin then there's five     
39:42     
disciplines involved yeah sorry I I know I said I     
39:48     
would get back to you about um some of this stuff too I know where it's faults about but     
39:57     
sure sure but it'd be really interesting because um you know bringing bringing     
40:02     
this down to a cellular level and thinking about t is U would be of real interest     
40:12     
so I can also try some of the slack forms for finite element packages that     
40:19     
you know other open source finement packages too yeah well if you can find     
40:25     
that does this slap cable thing yeah yeah if you if you if you've got a     
40:30     
bit of a description that you can post somewhere or or send to me then I'm I'm happy to to put this in very slack form     
40:39     
okay um I will yeah I'll just how about if I send everybody my     
40:45     
complaints     
40:51     
yes ltic grievances yeah yeah yeah so that yeah that's good and I     
40:58     
think like you know there yeah you're right there are a lot of packages that you could do like soft body modeling and     
41:05     
I think this holds true for op Norm as well it's hard to use a lot of the packages and outside of a small range of     
41:12     
sort of use cases and so you have to build tools sometimes you have to build     
41:17     
new tools to get what you exactly what you want and that's not great uh we need     
41:23     
more need more yeah I mean it came up with that um virtual you know virtual     
41:31     
dropa that you talked about Saturday you know right like they added things to Moko right that that were very you know     
41:45     
[Music]     
41:57     
yeah I mean well I I think it it shows you that you needed you know a really big team because you were I mean you     
42:04     
looked at that list and it was people all over and I think it was very much like who's got this this very     
42:09     
specialized expertise right yeah yeah that's yeah I think we     
42:17     
should have that conversation at some point though I think especially you know Hussein could be helpful here and kind     
42:22     
of you know maybe just even enumerating the things that are needed in like this     
42:28     
sort of community tool building or these open source tools for doing these kind of simulations sure it's definitely a     
42:37     
barrier to have like you know tools that you can't use when you where you want to use them and then you have to build a     
42:42     
new tool yeah yeah but it uh I mean I     
42:47     
was also wondering how useful yeah basically their work would be in terms     
42:53     
of sharing overlap with with open world yeah I think there's yeah I think there's some like new stuff that they've     
42:59     
done of course like they've done a lot of uh stuff with modeling you know with like compartment different     
43:05     
multicompartment modeling and things like that um and so yeah I didn't read     
43:11     
through the whole paper but it looks like they've done some really good work here uh especially with in terms of     
43:18     
modeling a body that can interact with the environment and the nervous system so you know     
43:25     
um they always try to pick the best tool for the job sometimes you have to create     
43:30     
your own tools to do that so like if you implement say a finite element uh model     
43:36     
you know you might have to do that you can do that maybe out of a package you have maybe have to home brew the whole     
43:43     
thing and start from scratch and then apply it directly to your problem so um     
43:48     
but it looks like they did the soft body simulation and finite element I think the soft body simulation you know we've     
43:54     
been kind of encountering a lot of cases where you know and of course the embryo     
43:59     
is a soft body uh it's not a hard body and so to really capture the Dynamics     
44:04     
properly you do need to have this soft body aspect to it and whatever that     
44:10     
means I mean I guess that means that you can model the cells not as uh cell you     
44:15     
know Square things but as squishy things or irregularly shaped things and that's     
44:21     
that's one of the things and I don't know if they're actually doing that here but that would be kind of you know adding the physics in like that is     
44:28     
really what's needed um and so yeah they they have there good stuff in here they     
44:36     
have uh Target body reference coordinate system uh so they have a lot of stuff in     
44:41     
here it's really interesting okay so that's good and then uh they have some supplementary movies     
44:48     
so if you go to uh there's actually U bioarchive preprint I'll open up the     
44:55     
link here and this is the bioarchive stub so they     
45:01     
have uh I don't know where they have the supplemental material here it is so this     
45:07     
is of course you can get access to the supplementary material and we have movies here I'm not going to open up the     
45:13     
movies because it's going to be I don't know how it's going to respond but basically we have movies here there     
45:20     
simulations and you can check those out um     
45:25     
yeah that would be I'd love to talk about that I I haven't actually checked out if     
45:32     
they've got a GI repo or um like which which particular packages they depend on     
45:39     
I think it would be great to look at the same time at what Josh bongard uses     
45:47     
in for his course in terms of tools right     
45:53     
um you know because you know as someone who's been so focused on evolutionary robotics     
45:59     
for so long at a software level I think his choices would be     
46:05     
really useful and enlightening     
46:11     
yeah yeah so there's an event coming up this week uh embodied uh cognition and     
46:17     
Hussein's presenting at that and so am I so uh but but Josh bongard I think is presenting there and there are a lot of     
46:24     
people interested in Soft Robotics there oh that's cool yeah so that'll be     
46:29     
there'll be a lot of new stuff maybe from people uh we'll see what what the state ofth art is on     
46:38     
that so to talk about the other paper here for today uh this is uh scientific     
46:46     
reports uh this is learning the Dynamics of realistic models of Sean's nervous     
46:51     
system with recurrent neural networks so they're interested in is kind of the     
46:56     
model of the connectone which we've talked about and using recurrent neural networks rnns to model this sort of     
47:05     
things so this is a group here I think they're Portuguese uh and they uh so     
47:11     
let's read the abstract uh so given the inherent complexity of the human nervous system     
47:17     
insight into the Dynamics of brain activity can be gained from studying smaller and simpler organisms which is     
47:24     
the celegans uh justification here um so you know while some of the     
47:31     
potential Target organisms are simple enough that their behavior on structural biology might be well known and     
47:37     
understood others might still lead to computationally intractable models that require extensive resources to simulate     
47:44     
so this one of the things about simulation as well is that you have to make the problem tractable so you can't     
47:50     
just simulate anything you want you have to pick up a problem domain or ideally     
47:56     
like you have to set up the problem so that you can actually run the thing and it gives you uh insightful results um     
48:05     
since such organisms are frequently only acting as proxies to further our     
48:10     
understanding uh often one is not interested in the details of detailed evolution of every single neuron in the     
48:17     
system instead it is sufficient to observe the subset of neurons that capture the effect that the     
48:23     
profound nonlinearities of the neuronal sub system have in response to different stimul so that's kind of what their     
48:30     
their justification for how they're approaching this so here they're considering the celan's connectum and     
48:37     
the seigan nervous system they want to investigate the possibility of generating lower complexity models so     
48:45     
they're not interested in the whole uh you know everything involved in sensing     
48:51     
something uh processing it in the connectome and then giving a behavioral output they're interested in isolating     
48:58     
certain parts of the nervous system uh so they can build these lower complexity     
49:04     
models uh that capture the systems Dynamics with low error using only measured or simulated input output     
49:11     
information so this is where you really have a very sparse model and this is of     
49:17     
course because sometimes you know the models that we just saw are going to take a lot of computational resources     
49:23     
having all these compartments to simulate so being able to do a very minimal model is always good just to be     
49:30     
able to capture some of the the essence of of the system you're ined in such     
49:36     
models are often termed blackbox models so blackbox models mean that you don't specify the details like you know you     
49:42     
might simulate neurons in a system you don't specify the biophysics the biophysics are implied uh which is the     
49:50     
case in most neural networks we can say okay this looks kind of like a neuron     
49:55     
but it's not really but it's good enough so that's why you know we use blackbox models and of course there's a whole     
50:01     
argument to be had about whether that's that's sufficient but that's beyond what     
50:06     
they're doing here we show how the nervous system of Clans can be modeled and simulated with     
50:13     
data driven models using different neural network architectures so now they're using data inputs from I guess     
50:20     
they could simulate them or get them from data sets and they have different neural network architectures they're     
50:25     
using uh specifically we target the use of state-of-the-art recurrent neural network     
50:31     
architectures such as long short-term memory which is lstm and gated recurrent     
50:38     
units uh and compare these architectures in terms of their properties and their accuracy and they use root mean square     
50:45     
error as a way to measure the error in the model so there are these different architectures of uh recursive uh neural     
50:53     
network they test those different architectures and they look at the error and how it minimizes the error as well     
51:00     
as the complexity of the resulting models we show that gated recurrent unit models with a hidden layer of size four     
51:08     
so this is where you have like the number of layers and the architecture that are specified and they     
51:15     
tested a range of those and they were saying that the Gated recurrent unit model of hidden layer size 4 is a able     
51:22     
to accurately reproduce the system response to very different stimulus so     
51:27     
this is where you have different types of stimulus coming in which model basically replicates the seelan connecto     
51:35     
the best which one fits what you might see in the biology the most uh     
51:41     
Faithfully we furthermore explore the relative importance of their inputs as well as their scalability for more     
51:47     
scenarios so this paper I wanted to bring this up because it kind of highlights this idea of minimal modeling     
51:55     
but also uh you know how you can use neural networks to kind of get at that and how     
52:02     
to simulate uh the connectome so they actually used uh the neuron Simulator     
52:07     
for this uh to build this uh connectome they obtained a collection of synthetic     
52:14     
data sets to represent the system's response to different input signals so you want to have different types of     
52:20     
stimulus to see uh if you know would if you're getting something that uh the the     
52:27     
connecto might be able to handle so you don't want to just try it on you know uh homogeneous training     
52:35     
data so this is uh yeah so they go through their uh work here and so this     
52:42     
is sort of their uh modeling methodology they have the connectome they have the ml framework they have a model they have     
52:50     
uh predicted outputs and true outputs so they can simulate the connectome get an out set of outputs and they can use     
52:57     
their models using the same input data and they can build predicted outputs then the idea is that you want to     
53:02     
minimize the error of the predicted outputs with respect to the true outputs so that's what they're doing     
53:10     
here and so I think that's a good lesson in how one can do that kind of a study     
53:16     
where you're looking at say uh biological information processing versus     
53:22     
something like a simulation and kind of comparing the to say this is realistic     
53:28     
in the first paper of course their goal also was to be hyper realistic and to get uh you know kind of lifelike     
53:36     
results so and they use similar methods use a finite element model but they're also trying to minimize the error with     
53:43     
respect to the biological     
53:50     
system all right um yeah minimizing the error with     
53:55     
respect to the the biological system like they compare the movement they're     
54:01     
getting to the movement in the biological system or how do they do that     
54:07     
yeah I guess you quantify the output well in this case they're Sim in the second paper they're simulating the     
54:12     
connectome so it's actually not bi it's biological in the sense that the simulation is on a connectone which is     
54:20     
biological and its origin so that's actually kind of simulated semi simulated     
54:26     
they're getting a result for that and then they're taking their model which is the neural network which is not     
54:33     
biological although you know it does process things you know the whole principle of neural networks is that it     
54:41     
works kind of like a brain I mean we you know there are debates about whether that's you know what the similarities     
54:48     
and differences are but they basically can produce an output and then that output gets minimized over uh time as     
54:55     
you train you know you the model it gives outputs you get you know over time     
55:00     
it converges to some solution and that solution needs to be close to the     
55:05     
observed values for say like the connectum simulation so that's what their rationale is there and uh in the     
55:13     
first paper you know we can actually get data on movement and we can quantify     
55:19     
that with you know uh tracking of the worm and things like that and we can get     
55:25     
as as long as we can create a curve curve we can say this is what the biology is doing and producing as an output and then we can simulate that and     
55:32     
actually see if we can match that yeah okay yeah yeah there's there's a fair     
55:38     
amount of systems biology operating on that principle that if you simulate um     
55:45     
you know if you can simulate a system you want to me it's a measure of the real system and then estimate kind of     
55:51     
get close to that uh performance yeah well I'm doing that with     
55:57     
uh stress strain curves I'm supposed to like find a real     
56:02     
system and then recreate the curve somehow right I have some ideas but     
56:10     
whether they'll like it or not I don't know yeah I showed them a 2d model last week and they were going what's this I     
56:18     
said I ask if I could go 2D you said yes     
56:24     
so anyway Yeah well yeah I think you're figuring out the methodology 2D is probably     
56:31     
better because it's less uh less you know you don't have to invest a lot in getting the you want to see what works     
56:38     
in 2D before you can like do the 3D yeah but I've already done 3D and of course     
56:45     
it sort of fell on its face partly because     
56:51     
of 3D gets very intensive so yeah I I don't get um the behavior     
57:00     
the 10 segurity Behavior out of a 2d model is rily as they do out of a 3D     
57:07     
model but I did manage to get some     
57:12     
uh Tegrity Behavior out of a 2d model so that was quite good especially since I     
57:18     
was using it Springs that are linear and anyway they saying you know that     
57:25     
Springs are linear right and I'm going yeah they're linear Springs I'm just trying this 2D model see I got a J     
57:34     
curve H anyway yeah but trouble is it was pushing a rope     
57:40     
apparently oh okay you don't do that the mechanical engineer on the     
57:46     
committee was going what you need to take more mechanics no     
57:53     
I'm I apologize for pushing a rope okay yeah anyway     
58:01     
yeah okay so that's great so that's uh the recent seans modeling papers I think     
58:08     
that's useful for a number of things and U I I I wanted to mention also that I'm     
58:14     
putting together a 10th anniversary slideshow on evil worm so next month is     
58:21     
dorm's 10th anniversary so we've been doing this collaboration for 10 years     
58:26     
and I I wanted to put together like a summary of everything and it's just kind of interesting going back and looking at     
58:32     
what we've been doing in the past and present and it's uh yeah so hopefully     
58:38     
you know I'll I'll try to produce uh I think probably one of the meetings in     
58:44     
April talk about it more and you know maybe that'll like bring some old topics     
58:50     
back up to the top so okay well next week I might not make it because I'm     
58:56     
going to SS scatch one okay yeah but     
59:02     
yeah so I think Pocky wanted to ask some questions I don't know if you are able     
59:08     
to talk or if you want to put them in     
59:14     
chat here I'll turn this off it doesn't help     
59:24     
there oh hello yes hi yeah hi hello everyone I hope I'm     
59:31     
audible yes yeah so I had a couple of     
59:37     
questions I went through the Devo graph repository and uh like     
59:44     
uh like I'll start with the code first so uh I wanted to ask like under the     
59:50     
stage one folder uh there is this RCN and mass segmentation so there are a couple of notebooks within that folder     
59:57     
so do they need to be like uh converted to complete pipelines to be merged with     
1:00:03     
like the demograph folder like the models over there is that like a requirement it's     
1:00:10     
not a requirement but uh you know may have the thing is is that you know some of these things we been working on them     
1:00:16     
in pieces so stage one is basically cell segmentation so you know we can do that     
1:00:24     
uh there are a number of different tools and I'm I really uh I've been trying to clean it up but it's it's been tough     
1:00:30     
because we've had multiple people kind of contributing um I don't think for the     
1:00:37     
uh for the sort of the uh proposal you need to do that but it would be     
1:00:43     
something if you wanted to propose it uh as part of the project this Summer that would be good um you know because what I     
1:00:51     
want to do this summer is I want to take I think we have things for each stage at this point     
1:00:56     
um and you know to try to get those into a pipeline or try to optimize those in some way that's really kind of what we     
1:01:03     
like to do so if you need to do that to get it running okay you know I mean     
1:01:09     
that's you don't have to do it right away I'm not really sure what the state of it is     
1:01:15     
though all right all right because like the third Point mentioned in the problem statement was like tightening the devap     
1:01:22     
of the devoor so I was like I wanted to ask if we have to integrate it in the pipeline okay uh other thing I had was     
1:01:31     
like uh we are basically monitoring the embryonic development of C Elegance     
1:01:36     
right uh correct me if I'm wrong yeah so yeah so I mean what what we at least at     
1:01:42     
this point what we would like to do is have a three-stage model where we take     
1:01:48     
stage one would be like cell segmentation so we have uh some data sets that we can use for celan's embryo     
1:01:56     
and uh you know we want to segment those cells and then we want to create like a a set of uh cells and then we want to     
1:02:04     
plug that in to stage two which is creating a graph embedding so once you     
1:02:10     
have the cell segmented you have features that you can then use in the graph embedding then the graph embedding     
1:02:17     
is something that you can produce in uh I think we have some software for that in there but there other uh you know     
1:02:24     
basically that's for from some other tools that exist out there and there are a lot of tools that can be integrated so     
1:02:31     
you know there's a lot of room for improvement on stage two stage one really is you know their tools there but     
1:02:38     
we have done a lot of work on the dvo learn platform so those are available     
1:02:44     
stage two there's uh stuff available from the outside world from the open     
1:02:49     
source world and that's creating the graph embeddings and then stage three is like creating visualizations     
1:02:56     
um hansu last summer hansi shogo worked on topological data analysis as a way to     
1:03:03     
visualize the graph embeddings and the results of that so you know one the     
1:03:09     
project basically is is taking those three stages and improving different parts of them uh stage one certainly     
1:03:16     
could be improved but stage two and three are probably the least developed and probably need the most work so     
1:03:22     
anyone any kind of combination of things that you opposed to do on any of those things is acceptable um I would like you     
1:03:31     
know I would like to see if you you know before you submit your proposal that you give me sort of an outline of what you     
1:03:37     
want to do I can you know in very specific terms so I can get a sense of what people want to do and if we we need     
1:03:45     
anything before we start the coding period to get get up to speed because some of these things um like I said you     
1:03:53     
know some of these things may be very easy to do some of these things may be very hard to do and so it's important to     
1:03:59     
be kind of kind of gauge how much work something is going to take because     
1:04:05     
that's important because you have you know a fine and amount of time to do it in     
1:04:12     
so yeah yeah I understand actually I came across a paper like a over a month     
1:04:19     
ago for some other project and I wanted to share it maybe I can post it in the chat yeah and uh basically that paper     
1:04:26     
they are like U they have uh proposed like a developing uh neural network that     
1:04:33     
basically mirrors the Key properties of embryonic development in biological     
1:04:38     
organisms so like uh uh this is actually a per yeah so uh I just wanted to ask if     
1:04:46     
this is something that could be useful because like I I didn't go through it thoroughly but uh like I thought maybe     
1:04:53     
we can if we are monitoring like the development of and then we can probably use this method     
1:05:00     
as well all right yeah do you have a better I mean I can't open this link I didn't see said my session had timed     
1:05:08     
out oh all right one second here's one more     
1:05:22     
L can you access this one I should be able too okay there yeah aive paper yeah     
1:05:30     
Sebastian reesei yeah towards self assembling artificial neural networks through neural developmental programs so     
1:05:36     
yeah this looks interesting this is uh yeah so this is uh from the AWI     
1:05:43     
conference last year so this is uh where they're do and of course uh Sebastian Rei's worked on some other uh things uh     
1:05:51     
in like I think Nerfs and other things that are interesting uh so the abstract reads here biological     
1:05:58     
nervous systems are created in fundamentally different ways and Cur current artificial neural networks     
1:06:04     
despite its impressive results in a variety of domains deep learning often requires considerable engineering effort     
1:06:11     
uh by contrast biological nervous systems are grown through a dynamic self-organizing process in this paper we     
1:06:18     
take initial steps towards neural networks that grow through a developmental process that mon mirrors     
1:06:24     
embryonic development this growth process is Guided by another neural network which we call a neural     
1:06:30     
developmental program and which operates through local communication loan yeah     
1:06:35     
this looks interesting I'd like to see uh maybe if you wanted to propose doing something with this I don't know if they     
1:06:42     
have their code open source I guess maybe they do um I would invest they do have a deposit I'll share that link yeah     
1:06:51     
so yeah they're doing uh using neural growth uh to sort of build machine     
1:06:57     
learning uh tools they're using different benchmarks and optimization methods and then future research     
1:07:04     
directions and opportunities yeah that would be great I mean we've done some of this in our other research group as well     
1:07:11     
uh different approaches to this not not exactly this approach because this is uh something for the neural network     
1:07:18     
Community specifically um this is an NDP this is the repo so this is     
1:07:27     
looks like some details of this paper so this is their methodology here this is a     
1:07:33     
neural developmental program graph at developmental step T so this is like a     
1:07:39     
fully connected triangle there's graph convolution then you have graph State s     
1:07:45     
updated by local information aggregation then graph growth where you add nodes in     
1:07:51     
and then Edge weights updated so yeah they're actually expanding Networks yeah this is something that we that would be     
1:07:57     
very useful I think if you wanted to do something in this area um because it     
1:08:02     
would be useful I think for a number of things in the group not just the graph neural network stuff yeah definitely     
1:08:09     
look into that and if you would like to propose something like that that would be acceptable as     
1:08:17     
well all right all right so yeah I just wanted to know if I'm headed in the right direction if this is useful to the     
1:08:24     
project yes it would definitely be definitely be useful all right thanks uh there are a     
1:08:30     
couple of more things actually I was documenting all my questions and then like there was the meeting link so I was     
1:08:36     
thinking it would be like an hour later so uh once I have all the questions maybe I can text you in slack will that     
1:08:42     
be all right yes yes please do all right thanks     
1:08:48     
great yes thank you Pocky yeah and so again uh we'll be     
1:08:54     
working on Google summer code projects people want to propose things you can bring them to one of our weekly meetings     
1:09:00     
or you can uh propose things in slack there are different ways to do that um     
1:09:05     
and the I think the um proposals are due sort of in April we're coming up on the     
1:09:12     
the time when they're closing so we have to I think we're they're already open so     
1:09:18     
we need to kind of get uh proposals locked down we need to get the     
1:09:24     
outline of the proposal and then we need to get the timeline of The Proposal which is where you know you have to     
1:09:30     
figure out what you can do in the amount of time that you have which is about 12     
1:09:35     
to 13 weeks so you know this is something that uh is like the skill one     
1:09:41     
of the skills you're trying to build in this program is how to schedule out a     
1:09:47     
project so you know what do you do first what do you do second but also how much work can you do in like a week and     
1:09:54     
that's that's always a challenge because sometimes things uh look easier than they are sometimes things are actually     
1:10:01     
easier than they look so you have to sort of manage your time     
1:10:10     
accordingly yeah all right I'll keep those things in mind thanks a lot you're yeah you're     
1:10:17     
welcome okay uh any other comments or     
1:10:24     
questions all right well yeah well thank you for attending today um and we have     
1:10:32     
we can keep in touch on slack uh over the week and then next week we'll have another meeting     
1:10:38     
so look forward to seeing people's progress um on numerous fronts here so     
1:10:45
