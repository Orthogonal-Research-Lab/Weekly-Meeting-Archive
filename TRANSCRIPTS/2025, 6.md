##  TRANSCRIPT

0:01     
Hi how are you how good     
0:07     
good there we go all right well     
0:16     
welcome so what's uh going on new     
0:22     
new um I don't know I've been looking up     
0:28     
papers about um tissue um modeled with t segres and     
0:35     
there aren't very many as far as I can see I'm supposed to do a review how do     
0:42     
you do a review with the three PL three Papers Plus your     
0:48     
own that's just not sure well you could go in depth in each     
0:53     
one I mean yeah that's that's true it's not not a review at that point it's more     
0:58     
well it is a review but it's more focused I guess are you sure there     
1:03     
were only four papers or there like things aren't called T segr that are     
1:09     
kind of similar I have one where they [Music]     
1:15     
um well it was working really great until the T segr did its thing which is     
1:20     
a soft mode and it just all of a sudden changed yeah so H not too sure about     
1:29     
that paper because it model worked fine until it didn't     
1:35     
yeah I don't even know what you would say about that     
1:41     
like I don't yeah I don't know yeah Ian you could like well you'd have to evaluate the results probably     
1:48     
make sure that it they didn't publish something that was just kind of like a a failure mode and they said oh that's     
1:55     
interesting yeah so then you'd have to redo their model Harden the dog     
2:00     
I have a dog she likes her spooky toy and it's annoying but     
2:09     
anyway she's a puppy yeah     
2:16     
yeah now here we're done anyway good enough that's what I been working all     
2:23     
right well that's good thanks for the update um and then lth how are you     
2:30     
uh good sir sir uh I've been looking at uh some of the GitHub repositories of     
2:38     
the dev and open and searching about what are the previous contributions and     
2:43     
all so I got I got to find out some of the know this structural connectomes of     
2:50     
uh you know the cgans so I'm trying to I've tried to load it and see how's uh     
2:57     
there are like some few good visualizations toool also Al so I've been looking at them and uh I'm     
3:03     
interested I've have seen some good uh good paper recently I don't know I have     
3:09     
to go through it a little bit it's little complicated so what they have done is they have done this functional     
3:15     
connectivity and uh it got uh published in nature 2023 I guess so it's from uh     
3:23     
Professor uh uh lers lab from like Princeton so they have they have seen     
3:31     
that uh so I'm just reading this you know that uh the neural signal     
3:37     
propagation how it's happening for C Gans and all so it's was kind of little interesting because so although we have     
3:45     
like wired structural connectivity and the connects are like very very much you     
3:51     
know wired entirely but there are some activations uh and there is some signal     
3:56     
propagation although there was no like wiring and all so so so that was a good     
4:04     
line of work I wanted to you know go a little deeper and understand I'm trying to see the code of them so it's open     
4:11     
source and they said all the figures and everything can be reproduced so I'm looking at their work and little more     
4:17     
deeper into like what we can do     
4:24     
okay that's good I don't know if if     
4:31     
uh I guess um mahul said he might be here but I don't think he is going to     
4:38     
come he wants to do a presentation on some of the hypergraph work he was doing     
4:43     
last year so if he comes next week we'll you know we'll be able to see that     
4:49     
but yeah that's that sounds like a good paper can you send that paper along to me at some point like yeah I can send it     
4:58     
just uh I mean like I just attached or I can attach in the slack it     
5:03     
be great yeah yeah actually if you could put a link in the chat here it'll be good or something like     
5:12     
that right so anth     
5:23     
hello L is there you want to introduce yourself     
5:31     
was Morgan little Morgan     
5:38     
dick good morning oh good morning so last time uh lth and was talking about     
5:45     
this comparison between artificial neural networks and biological neural networks and I brought up the paper that     
5:52     
we mentioned in the meeting where that we we had done in 2021 in in our group     
5:58     
where we looked at it a couple of different Criterion for differences between the two types of model or or at     
6:05     
least real brains and the model of a and so you know we have to think about kind     
6:11     
of those differences because people want to sort of you know they want to     
6:17     
recapitulate biological brains they don't want to I mean they want to make artificial models better but ultimately     
6:24     
the goal is to sort of emulate a real brain or emulate what things a real brain does that are     
6:31     
interesting so you know this is nice to have this sort of comparison to lay out     
6:36     
the different things that people might focus on Focus their work on     
6:42     
to uh you know get move towards that goal so this paper here I think this is     
6:49     
a neural computation yes this is a neural computation paper uh the title     
6:55     
and I'm not crazy about the title but whatever modern AR official neural networks is evolution clever and this is     
7:04     
um I think it's by a German group or also you know there's an American in there but um anyways this is about     
7:13     
looking and and they don't talk about Evolution much in the paper let's kind of talk about it at the end but the idea     
7:20     
is that Evolution produced biological neural networks therefore it's maybe clever than we can or more clever than     
7:28     
we can have and in terms of artificial neural networks and something that you     
7:33     
know we kind of construct from this this metaphor that we're using so I'll go through the abstract um     
7:41     
there's a lot of detail in the paper so if you're interested in um you know     
7:47     
looking that up it's actually this neurocomputation paper from     
7:52     
2023 uh so the abstract reads machine learning tools particularly artificial     
7:58     
mural Networks or Anns it become ubiquitous in many scientific disciplines and machine learning based     
8:05     
techniques flourish not only because of the expanding computational power and increasing availability of labeled data     
8:12     
sets so this is where we have these you know we we have this ability to sort of     
8:17     
make these models work through a lot of training and a lot of computational     
8:24     
power now of course biological brains you know one of the sort of the benefits     
8:29     
of that or we emulating the way it does computation is     
8:34     
it doesn't take that much energy at all at least comparable and you don't necessarily     
8:40     
need a lot of information or training to do things there are a lot of things that     
8:45     
biological brains can do that require very little interaction with the world at least relative to the sorts of     
8:52     
training regimes we use and a uh so that's you know this is why     
8:58     
they're flourishing but also because of the increasingly powerful training algorithms and refined topologies of     
9:04     
artificial neural networks so this is where you know we have these topologies     
9:10     
that we can uh you know we we can select for certain weights uh weight schemes     
9:18     
and we can get good topologies that are optimized for learning at least certain tasks so one     
9:26     
of the pro drawbacks of course to Ann's is that we have a hard time generalizing them to     
9:32     
other tasks so we can really you know use a lot of data train them for a single task but then when it comes to     
9:38     
generalizing to new things that the network hasn't seen before it becomes harder and so what we do have powerful     
9:46     
training algorithm so this is one of the you know the great breakthroughs of the     
9:52     
last maybe 10 years or 15 years some refined topologies were initially motivated by neuronal Network Arch arure     
9:59     
is found in the brain so sometimes if we use neuronal Network as a term for     
10:05     
bnns we you know have convolutional artificial neural networks which are     
10:10     
like uh neural neuronal network architectures in the brain later     
10:15     
topologies of neuronal networks departed from the biological substrate began to be developed independently as the     
10:22     
biological processing units are not well understood or are not transferable to in silic architectures so again you know we     
10:30     
have this sort of abstraction problem where we have maybe the single unit that does a single     
10:36     
computation and then we could have you know maybe a single unit with multiple     
10:41     
compartments but we don't really use say like all of the things that we have in a     
10:46     
neuron that is to say we don't have like a molecular scale set of processes that     
10:53     
have an output we don't have uh you know bio bioh physics we don't have action     
11:00     
potentials that produce an output we sum inputs and produce an output but those     
11:06     
are all computational in nature and so you know you could argue well the brain     
11:12     
kind of does this anyways the lower level details don't matter but obviously     
11:18     
there is something there that's going on that we don't know if it really matters or not we just say that this is     
11:25     
basically what it's doing you now that's kind of the point of abstraction you take a real world system and you say     
11:32     
this is basically the way the system works if we were to take a pendulum and we were going to build a a physical     
11:38     
model of the pendulum we're going to build a computational model that we would put into some coding language like     
11:44     
python we would take the sort of the you know most basic elements of that     
11:51     
relationship of the pendulum and put them into an equation and model that     
11:57     
equation but you know they're also sorts of stochastic fluctuations that might account for variations in the pendulum     
12:03     
that we don't add into that model and so you see a difference and so you might say well why     
12:09     
don't we just add in um you know some sort of stochastic signal into neural     
12:14     
networks and I think you know even if we did that we'd be missing other processes     
12:19     
that are kind of uh contributing maybe additively or multiplicatively to the     
12:25     
output that we see in biological nors anyways that's that's an aside that's something to think about in terms     
12:31     
of you know what the differences are um in in the paper we did in from 2021 you     
12:39     
know we didn't even I don't think we talk too much about that I'd like to revisit that though in any case um and so you know we     
12:47     
started with these kind of models that were abstracted away from biology but     
12:52     
then we're sort of you know we we kind of thought well this is basically what's going on in the brain and of course this     
12:58     
was back in the 1940s and 1950s you know where you have the Mulla     
13:03     
pittz neuron and then later you have these early connectionist models and     
13:09     
people you know basically use the general principles of the brain at least as people saw them then and said well     
13:16     
that okay we can build a model from that and so you know we have these models     
13:22     
that are sort of semi biologically inspired but of course later topologies     
13:27     
of neuronal networks dep parted from the biological substrate and began to be developed independently as the     
13:34     
biological processing units are not well understood or not transferable in silico     
13:40     
architectures so what that sentence I guess means is that you know we have this sort     
13:48     
of model and we kind of think okay this is basically what's going on in the brain but now we need to make it you     
13:54     
know we now we need to add some technical details and so as added in technical details they departed from     
14:02     
what whatever was sort of similar from the biological substrate and um we can't seem to     
14:09     
transfer some of the key sort of uh     
14:14     
details from biological neural networks to artificial neural     
14:20     
networks in the field of Neuroscience the Advent of multi- Channel recordings has enabled recording the activity of     
14:26     
many neurons simultaneously the Char characterizing complex network activity and biological neural networks the     
14:33     
unique opportunity to compare large neural network topologies processing and learning strategies with those that have     
14:40     
been developed in state-of-the-art a Anns has become a reality okay uh then     
14:47     
you know so we have these tests these statistical tests we can use of course that will     
14:52     
compare uh you know something like uh you know some structure in the visual cortex with maybe like uh a an     
15:01     
artificial neural network that does feature selection in uh a database of     
15:07     
images so there there's a biological neural network doing something similar to what an artificial n neural network     
15:14     
is doing maybe on a benchmarking task and then there's statistical methods where you can compare the networks you     
15:21     
can extract a neuronal network from uh the visual cortex like some somewhere     
15:27     
like V1 or V2 and then compare that with a neural network that's processing     
15:32     
images and doing feature selection so they're doing the same task but they're     
15:38     
you know of course they're different networks they're doing things differently and we can actually see how     
15:45     
well they're correlated and how well they are related to one another um but     
15:51     
that's you know that's kind of limiting because that doesn't tell us a whole lot other than that they seem to have     
15:56     
similar behaviors inside the network everything else is really kind of a blackbox so that's that's one of the     
16:04     
challenges is finding these kind of comparative techniques so um the aim of this review     
16:11     
is to introduce certain basic concepts of the modern artificial neural network corresponding training algorithms and     
16:17     
biological counterparts the selection of these modern artificial neural networks is prone to be biased uh they exclude     
16:25     
spiking neural networks which are these neural networks that have like a biophysical component um so they you     
16:32     
know those are different in terms of how they're they uh the what the outputs look like and the sort of activation     
16:39     
function they use and so forth so this is kind of an overview of     
16:45     
this these artificial neural networks as they see them um they talk about the     
16:52     
early days of artificial neural networks with McCulla and pittz and then Conrad     
16:58     
Zeus who developed the first computers um Marvin Minsky uh then the     
17:05     
perceptron with Rosen blat and Whitman and they were able to kind of move from     
17:10     
that to uh this sort of connectionist view so this is all kind of going     
17:16     
through this history and talking about how our artificial models ver arose and     
17:22     
then how they diverged from the biological reality and some of this was     
17:28     
or a lot of this was because of the technical challenges so you know you you create a simple     
17:33     
model you try to improve that model improve its performance and then you use     
17:39     
of course computational techniques and you diverge from the biology uh the granted at the time     
17:47     
computational biology and theoretical biology in their infancy so we had you     
17:53     
know we didn't have some of the tools maybe we have today although I would say that there hasn't been a huge amount of     
17:59     
work in this Direction that's really you know obviously because we don't really have the tools to do really good     
18:06     
comparisons so that's uh that paper um I don't know if lth had anything to     
18:14     
say about that or if you wanted to comment if anyone else wanted to comment     
18:21     
on oh that that was a interesting line of work sir because it focuses on the     
18:27     
topology and uh you know how the structures are actually you know they are meant and all and uh they're     
18:34     
although they are excluding the spiking part uh it it it will help to understand     
18:40     
how it has been emerged from like you know the smaller set of neural networks     
18:45     
to that of what are we currently facing challenges so if I it could be a nice R     
18:52     
if I go detail into it yeah okay anyone else     
18:59     
okay well welcome soam I see soam is     
19:05     
here hey I sorry I got a bit late okay did you have anything to say or update     
19:11     
us with uh no I was just going through a few papers I have a few ideas I'll     
19:17     
concretize it and let you know in the next next meets okay sounds     
19:24     
good okay so then uh the other paper I want to talk about to today is this uh     
19:31     
paper by Mana and Leven this is a Micha Len paper this is a pre-print that he's put out on field mediated bioelectric     
19:39     
basis of morphogenetic prepatterning so this is uh on this is     
19:44     
on some pretty hefty uh sort of bioelectric Developmental stuff so this     
19:52     
is really kind of getting deep into this sort of uh topic so you know if there     
19:59     
some technical details that we don't understand this is something that I don't know if I can help with but we'll     
20:06     
see um and so of course Michael Lan has done a lot of stuff with this     
20:11     
bioelectric communication so you know neurons of course have bioelectric     
20:17     
communication we're familiar with um you know with action potentials and we're     
20:22     
familiar with gap Junctions and we know that like you know neurons Express     
20:28     
different ions channels different neurons Express different mixes of ion channels and we have you know tools to     
20:35     
look at that and say something about the bioelectric potential of a neuron well     
20:41     
of course neurons come from stem cells and those stem cells uh you know you get     
20:46     
different differentiation signals and you can get things like muscle or other types of cells and so muscles also have     
20:53     
some bioelectric potential and so we know how to measure that and then of course we we have other types of cells     
21:00     
that are somatic cells you know and those cells have as it turns out     
21:05     
bioelectric potential they express ion channels just like neurons and muscle uh     
21:11     
even stem cells Express ion channels and so you know so they have this sort of     
21:18     
potential and just because neurons have an action potential doesn't mean that     
21:23     
other cell types don't have some sort of Trace that you can measure now it's not     
21:29     
going to be a spike like you see in a action potential but it's going to be     
21:34     
something else it's going to be a different type of signal nevertheless we can use that signal to understand what     
21:40     
cells are doing and so Mike 11 is picked up on this tradition of you know there's a a     
21:47     
tradition that goes back maybe to the early 20th century of people looking at bioelectric signals in cells and     
21:55     
thinking that that plays a really important role in development so in development we've talked about gene     
22:01     
expression we've talked about physical forces and you know bioelectricity of     
22:06     
course plays a role but that's actually less explored in the modern literature anyways every time you see a big nature     
22:13     
paper they don't really talk about bioelectricity as a as a topic um so     
22:20     
keep that in mind as we go through this abstract so the abstract reads bioelect     
22:28     
communication among cells plays an important role in numerous morphogenetic     
22:34     
processes computational modeling and experimental modulation of these processes have largely focused on a     
22:41     
discrete localized view of cells and intracellular     
22:49     
networks so you know we're kind of thinking in terms of computational models and these computational models     
22:56     
like our artificial neural networks are discrets units that are linked by edges     
23:02     
that have some weight and that's the way we usually Model A lot of networks and     
23:08     
models of cells and intracellular networks of different types so a lot of     
23:15     
these you know we have to use these kind of models to understand spatio temporal     
23:20     
patterns in the in the in in biology we saw a paper last     
23:26     
week where they did things with uh nextg sequencing so they were looking     
23:32     
at what single cells are expressing certain uh genes and in G different Gene     
23:40     
families and then you know they were able to produce a map where you knew what cell was what and what position it     
23:47     
was in and you could get a sense and see Elegance at least of spacial patterning     
23:53     
well a lot of times we don't have the luxury of understanding spatial patterning in that way so there is like     
23:59     
the model that you see in dropa where you can see the striping in a a centium and you can     
24:07     
measure that with some sort of microscopy in this case what they're interested in are these networks or the     
24:14     
spatial variability with respect to bio El electricity and so you're getting the     
24:21     
spatio temporal patterns of resting membrane potential what they call VM     
24:26     
within tissues so you're getting this membrane potential of the cells you can     
24:31     
measure that you can use different types of photovoltaic dieses you can use uh     
24:37     
different types of electrodes and get that measurement and then see you know what that looks like across the tissue     
24:44     
and maybe what role that plays in Collective organization of the     
24:50     
cells okay so here we characterize novel contributions of the electrostatic force     
24:55     
field a continuous and pervasive entity existing within living tissues and     
25:01     
modulating intracellular interactions so they're talking about this electrostatic force field which     
25:07     
sounds a little bit like they came up with it in Star Wars but it's not it's     
25:12     
this Force you know where all the cells sort of have this electrostatic potential and it's this emergent     
25:19     
phenomena and so you know there there's this idea of course that you know in um     
25:29     
there's this idea of or this notion of morphogens which are these organizers     
25:34     
and they play a role in uh morphogenesis in this case what they're     
25:40     
kind of arguing is it's electrostatic force field plays a role in morphogenesis and it's very similar to     
25:46     
the role morphogens play in chemical morphogenesis     
25:51     
so uh so this electrostatic force field is a continuous and pervasive entity     
25:57     
existing within living tissues in modulating intercellular interaction so this is a continuous model so if we were     
26:04     
to model this electrostatic force field computationally we'd have to choose a continuous modeling framework to do this     
26:12     
and we'd also have to account for sort of its pervasiveness and so this is of     
26:18     
course a very different model than what we you know from a network model so that     
26:23     
that's kind of their where they're going with this and uh Mike Lev has published paper on this in the past so this is not     
26:30     
nothing new he's done a lot of stuff um in model organisms that have shown like     
26:36     
demonstrated a lot of this uh we consider a minimal but     
26:42     
biologically plausible non neurobo electric Network model endowed with with     
26:48     
an electrostatic field where the VM or that potential membrane potential of a     
26:54     
cell is regulated by the average strength of the surrounding field via negative feedback so that resting     
27:01     
membrane potential is of course sort of the Baseline and then that's regulated     
27:08     
by the the strength of the surrounding field so it's almost like you have a     
27:14     
membrane potential in one cell that's influenced by the membrane potential of other cells and that's how you have this     
27:20     
you know it's almost like if you were to have a cellular automo mod and you had a     
27:26     
neighborhood of cells so this the cell in the middle is influenced by its neighbors and then every cell has     
27:33     
neighbors surrounding it and those neighborhoods exist in parallel and     
27:39     
there's this sort of feedback or negative feedback in this case between the focal cell and its neighbors and     
27:46     
then this happens in parallel across the field or across the tissue or whatever     
27:52     
entity we're talking about a detailed examination of this     
27:57     
model r that the field systematically regulates key statistical and dynamical     
28:03     
characteristics of spatio temporal configurations of V men patterns such as     
28:08     
complexity dimensionality and causality leveraging a mechanism akin to     
28:14     
synergetics where it simultaneously forms a lower dimensional projection of the pattern and     
28:21     
enhances the causal strength and distance among its components so the synergetic     
28:29     
I we'll get into this I think they'll probably review this in the paper but this is a form of complexity Theory     
28:35     
where they have formal models uh we'll get into what that is and then we have     
28:41     
this lower dimensional projection of the pattern H being enhanced by the causal     
28:46     
strength and distance among its components so I don't know exactly what that means but basically you get this     
28:53     
sort of uh you know this projection of a pattern through this these Co these     
29:00     
Dynamics and then there's this reinforcement that occurs across the     
29:06     
tissue moreover the almost instantly penetrating nature of the field endows the system with a unique amenability to     
29:13     
self-organize complex positional information patterns following a transient stimulation of just the     
29:20     
boundary of the tissue so when we talk about this complex positional information we're talking about cells     
29:27     
kind having uh a location and you know they obviously cells don't carry around a map     
29:35     
or they don't have maybe they have some sort of uh accounting mechanism that it would be kind of hard to implement if     
29:42     
the cells are moving you know they're migrating and things like that so you have to have this sort of system of sort     
29:50     
of co-registration with the rest of the tissue so cells know where they are in     
29:56     
in the anthropomorphic sense um so yeah that's and then you talk okay     
30:02     
so that's that part and so then they propos that this     
30:12     
uh this self organization of complex positional information of patterns has     
30:17     
this organizer like property that suggests new avenues for modulation and biomedical contexts so this could be     
30:25     
applied to some sort of biomedical context or um bioengineering context synthetic     
30:32     
biology context we used automatic differentiation based machine learning methods to optimize signals from a     
30:39     
symmetry breaking organizer region which would induce development of a vertebrate face pre pattern so they're looking for     
30:47     
this face pre pattern they want to sort of simulate this face pre pattern um     
30:53     
they want to use so they're using differentiation based machine learning methods     
30:58     
they're basically trying to take signals from this uh region of of cells this     
31:04     
bioelectric pattern or the these signals and then develop this pattern in     
31:10     
silicone as I understand a detailed spatio temporal     
31:15     
dynamical analysis of a pair of such models with differing degrees of field sensitivity revealed very different     
31:22     
Collective coordination strategies with which the model developed the pattern namely a performed Mo preformed Mosaic     
31:30     
mechanism and an emergent s meric mechanism so this is you know kind of     
31:35     
arguing that there is this sort of maybe this preformation aspect that's     
31:42     
initiated by bio El electricity and then there's this emergent stigmergic     
31:48     
mechanism uh which stigmergy of course is where you have a system where there     
31:55     
interactions and then there's a trace left of those interactions and that Trace then forms     
32:01     
these patterns so if you think about like ant colonies when ants walk around     
32:07     
a surface looking for food they drop a pheromone Trail those pheromone Trails then are reinforced by other ants     
32:13     
following along and so you end up with these ant trails that form this emergent     
32:20     
structure and it allows ants to find food you know they're able to navigate a     
32:26     
space they're able B to basically weigh down the precursors for positional     
32:32     
information and guide other ants to the food source and this is done more efficiently there are these pheromones     
32:38     
or the stigmergic set of interactions between ants where one ant will lay down     
32:44     
a pheromone Trail another ant will pick it up and reinforce that trail and so forth so this is what he means by sort     
32:51     
of this a mergent stigmergic mechanism it's some sort of mechanism that reinforces an initial pattern so it may     
32:58     
be a pre-form pattern it may be something that kind of emerges from the most likely interactions and then is uh     
33:05     
and then is Amplified accordingly the stigmergic pattern in     
33:11     
particular recapitulated several key features of the developmental sequence of the bioelectric facial pre pattern     
33:18     
observed in frog embryos so they're able to see this analogy with frog     
33:24     
embryos um these results highlight the promising potential itial of the electric field per se as a facilitator     
33:31     
of collective patterning providing a kind of Master regulator Interventional Target for applications in regenerative     
33:39     
medicine and bioengineering so this you know he's been working into this direction of trying to you know find ways to build in     
33:48     
these regulatory systems for things like synthetic biology or bioengineering where you're trying to     
33:55     
pattern different types of a higher order tissues or you know     
34:02     
patterns on tissues or organized things like faces in a in a from a a group of     
34:09     
tissues so if you think about like in tissue engineering when you want to you     
34:15     
know achieve some sort of pattern or some sort of you know if you wanted to build a face or if you wanted to build     
34:22     
an organ this would you know this kind of mechanism would work so I know that     
34:28     
Morgan in particular is interested in organoids you know you could think about the problems that we have with organoids     
34:35     
as an example of how this could solve that problem namely that organoids will form these structures we have to do a     
34:42     
lot of careful bioengineering to get those structures and then we have to sort of combine different uh organoids     
34:50     
together into these assembl loids and so you know one of the things we could do of course or one of the things we don't     
34:57     
do is we don't think about the bioelectric aspect of it I don't think anyone really     
35:03     
aside from maybe recording bioelectricity they don't leverage it to sort of sculpt these organoids and use     
35:12     
them as instructive signals re forming patterns I'm not aware of any such research okay so the biological field is     
35:18     
this concept that they're using this goes back many years and there's this idea more commonly known as the     
35:24     
morphogenetic field in modern developmental biology it expresses informational Regional     
35:30     
relationships the prototypical example of which is the morphagene gradient or the French flag model and is often     
35:37     
referred to or as it is often referred to uh and then he brings up Turing who     
35:44     
of course was trying to find some sort of substrate inv variant decision-making system and he had this biochemical basis     
35:51     
of such a system mimicking the self-organizing properties of embryos so this is in reference to some of the work     
35:58     
he did not only on chemical morphogenesis but then kind of transferring that in the direction of uh     
36:04     
artificial intelligence and I'm not familiar with what these references are but uh basically gets into that history     
36:11     
of that work now I know that dick has mentioned in years past that he doesn't     
36:17     
believe in morphogenetic fields I guess but this is kind of where you know the     
36:22     
the model that Levan is using um so I mean you know it's not without its     
36:27     
controversy it's not without its sort of taking a position on um so that's that's basically what     
36:34     
we're doing here so one important set of biological Regulators concerns ionic signaling all cells not just neurons     
36:41     
communicate electrically and Vivo so this is where uh you have this uh     
36:47     
literature on ionic signaling and how that can play a role in     
36:53     
patterning um bioelectric properties and tissue have been shown to underly pre     
36:59     
patterns regulating the formation of complex structures such as the vertebra face axial patterning of the anterior     
37:08     
posterior dorsal vental and left right axes so it's front to back side to side     
37:14     
and top to bottom in a in an organism like seans or in an organism like a     
37:21     
lizard where they have those are the orientations of the spatial axes the     
37:28     
location and identity of specific organs such as the eye and the Egg ovary system     
37:34     
patterning of epithelia such as Skin and feathers and size control so last week we talked about feathers and scales and     
37:41     
hair follicles and so those of course form from a maybe like a stem amnio     
37:47     
common ancestral um sort of set of uh processes     
37:53     
that form this invagination in the uh epidermal layer and then you get these     
38:00     
different structures that can form later so in this case though he's arguing that     
38:05     
there's this epithelial mechanism that also plays a role in these types of     
38:10     
things and that's something that we don't usually talk about when we talk about these     
38:17     
things so bio electricity is also important because there're a number of gene expression and epigenetic targets     
38:24     
out wide Downstream with these changes in biological or in bio electric state so basically bio El electricity sets up     
38:31     
at least causally some of these changes in gene expression and epigenesis so you     
38:37     
know we we think of those things as sort of maybe autonomous or we focus on the     
38:42     
uh environmental signals if we do something like a perturbation study which we saw last week with the feathers     
38:47     
and scales paper but in this case he's saying that the bioelectric state is     
38:53     
actually the c one of the main causal factors in this so this is their model here and it does     
39:00     
look kind of like maybe like a cellular autometa it's really just an array of     
39:07     
cells where you have this continuous model so you have this uh blast joa on     
39:13     
the left which is this clump of cells and this is a blow up of like a piece of the blastous of these cells     
39:20     
here are represented by cells in this array and we have the individual cells     
39:28     
we have the electrostatic fields which are these red lines we have the ion channels which are these black little     
39:34     
squares on top of the cells or around the sides we have these Gap Junctions     
39:39     
which are these gray lines I don't know if you can see but basically we're representing this electrical sort of     
39:46     
pass through communication and GAP Junctions we're representing ION channel     
39:51     
communication across the membrane with these black squares we have this electrostatic field which is     
39:58     
generated um in this you know by the balance of ions in the red lines and     
40:03     
then the cells themselves so the cells interact um based on these different     
40:08     
sources of electricity and uh field generating uh phenomena and then we get     
40:16     
this field grid which is this uh these gray dots and they just form this grid     
40:22     
so all these cells are related by this field and the electrostatic field of     
40:27     
course affects the local cells and this happens in parallel so if you move from     
40:33     
one end of the field that he specifies to the other you get different electrostatic fields that interact and     
40:41     
so this is where we get this what you know this sort of emerging Collective     
40:47     
behavior is from all of this happening in parallel and so this shows figure two     
40:54     
snatic snapshots of the elatic force fields that are profiles of the model     
41:01     
where a s when a single cell is active so if we look up at the to top left image we see that Single Cell Activation     
41:09     
is happening in this top set of uh examples then tissue activation is at     
41:15     
the bottom set of the examples so let's go to the top left where we have short R uh short field range so we have the cell     
41:22     
here it's in the middle and it has this force field that only involves one C cell so that's a localized effect then     
41:32     
the field range expands so it expands from the single around just around the Single Cell to a neighborhood of two     
41:41     
cells deep so it's like two cells beyond the Single Cell in every direction and     
41:46     
so you know this is kind of like a cellular automet neighborhood where you have neighbors and they have a state and     
41:54     
then you're you know kind of integrating that information and you're doing that locally in parallel so this intermediate     
42:01     
field range includes two cells out from the center cell and all these cells are     
42:07     
in this field and then imagine that every cell has an intermediate field of the same size and you can see where     
42:13     
these interactions can occur so again this involves more cells     
42:18     
and then the long field range is this entire array of cells which en so the field is Encompass this entire array of     
42:25     
cells so it really depends on the field range that depends what the interactions look like you can sometimes have only     
42:32     
one cell in that field range multiple cells in the field range and having this happen in parallel and then a long field     
42:38     
range where there's a long cast signal that casts over many many cells and     
42:46     
these things can happen in parallel but you know the reality of it is that the     
42:51     
long field range uh you know is sort of this uh maybe Global signal     
42:58     
so this is okay when the cell is active top row then when the entire tissue is     
43:03     
voltage pattern bottom row so in the top three examples we have Single Cell     
43:08     
Activation which is where uh the single cell is active and then at the bottom     
43:14     
the entire tissue is voltage patterned meaning that we have these different sort of orientations in the field and     
43:21     
that leads to these spatial patterns so for short field range we see this here     
43:26     
where we have this pattern which is differentiated on the left side on the right side uh there these differences in the     
43:34     
field the orientation of the field uh and the intermediate field range we kind     
43:40     
of see the same thing um and then in the long field range it kind of focuses on     
43:47     
this area here so I'm never really sure what the lesson is from     
43:53     
this um     
43:58     
but yeah this so the darker shaded units in this tissue activation model uh     
44:05     
represents more hyperpolarized potentials so these cells have different potentials and then it leads to     
44:11     
patterning so you can see that the ones in Black here are more hyperpolarized than the ones in Gray and of course     
44:20     
that's where you get this difference in polarization it's not like a action potential uh but it's like     
44:27     
kind of a similar principle where there's an activation versus a non-activation and so that's kind of     
44:34     
what we're looking at in this array and then they have this 11 by1     
44:40     
model that generates patterns a short field range is pretty much you know this     
44:45     
block intermediate field range has some pattern formation on the edges then the     
44:50     
long field range you get this uh gradient of colors here which I guess is     
44:56     
where they're generating different patterns um so at the top we have weak     
45:01     
field sensitivity short field range intermediate field range and long field range all having different sorts of um     
45:10     
sensitivities and and pattern formation potential then on the bottom we have strong field     
45:16     
sensitivity uh which is where we have high W and low B which are the top we     
45:22     
have low W and high B and they uh Define these parameters values in the paper um     
45:30     
just uh know that there's a difference between weak and strong field sensitivity you get this again with     
45:38     
strong field sensitivity short field range it gives you a little bit different um uh result on this pattern     
45:46     
but most of it is the same most of is the same intermediate field range you're starting to get this     
45:53     
broken up pattern formation you're starting to get these centers and then long field range you just see something     
45:59     
in the Middle with some Decay at the edges so that's kind of and then these     
46:05     
again these darker Shades represent more hyperpolarized potentials meaning of     
46:10     
course that these cells are more differentiated in the long field range     
46:16     
and in the intermediate field range so that's basically what they're trying to argue so basically the idea is that U     
46:25     
these electrical potentials are activated in cells that activation     
46:31     
then leads to gene expression and then gene expression changes lead to these sort of pattern phenotypes differences     
46:38     
in gene expression can lead to differences in morphology or in other     
46:44     
types of signaling that are happening so it's basically the C sort of the     
46:50     
beginning of the causal chain I think is what they're arguing so in summary these observations show that owing a     
46:57     
conventional bioelectric system with an electrostatic field enhances its     
47:02     
patterning capacity is evidenced by an increase in the complexity of v-men patterns with an increase in the ability     
47:09     
of the cells to sense changes in the field surrounding them so it's actually     
47:14     
that there's this complexity of vman patterns in a field this allows for     
47:20     
cells to sense changes in the field surrounding them because the field becomes more heterogeneous and you can     
47:26     
detect differences and so cells will do this sort of it's almost like a psychophysics where they can detect     
47:33     
changes across space some resolution so if you have like a sharp drop off or a     
47:41     
gradual drop off that's something is cell consense and behave accordingly so     
47:46     
this complexity of the field is very important     
47:51     
and they get into much more detail in the paper this so they actually have this complexity measure I'm not really     
47:57     
familiar with it but this is the tanon Edelman sporns complexity measure so     
48:02     
these are three people who are involved in um a lot of different areas of     
48:09     
research uh I think tanon is involved in Consciousness research Edelman is a big     
48:14     
name in in biology and in other uh in in brain science and then sporns of course     
48:20     
does a lot of stuff with brain science but also complex networks so they have this complexity measure D which they'll     
48:27     
be using this is an information theoretic quantity so Ton's integrated     
48:33     
information is kind of related to this uh and it quantifies the trade-off     
48:38     
between integration and segregation of the vmin patterns and multiple spatial     
48:43     
scales so it's looking at sort of the total sum of mutual information between     
48:49     
bipartitions of the system covering all partition sizes so they kind of do talk     
48:55     
about this in the methods but BAS basically it's a way to understand the complexity of these fields the     
49:01     
heterogeneity of these fields and to get a single measure of this get a single parameter that tells you something about     
49:08     
the information of these fields when the tissue is fully integrated the cells tend to behave synchronously as a single     
49:15     
whole and when it is fully segregated the cells tend to behave independently so if we look at the     
49:22     
tissue being fully integrated uh and the cells behav synchronously or when this tissue is     
49:29     
fully segregated and the cells behave independently TSA tsse is zero so when     
49:36     
we have basically total homogeneity total dissociation of the     
49:42     
cells tsse is zero when we have the sort of heterogeneity of a tissue then the     
49:49     
tsse is nonzero and that's what we're interested in we're interested in maximizing that complexity measure um     
49:57     
in whatever way that that H it happens so complexity is maximized when the     
50:02     
balance between the opposing forces of integration and segregation are     
50:07     
maximized which is precisely what a good patterning mechanism must possess since a pattern by definition requires a     
50:15     
mixture of correlated and uncorrelated regions so this goes back to our locals     
50:20     
versus global uh distinction so locally we expect things to be correlated     
50:25     
especially in a spatial array and the reason for that is because local things     
50:31     
should tend to behave together they're signaling each other they're communicating they might be of the same     
50:38     
tissue they might be doing similar things in space and so those things should be correlated we should also have     
50:45     
over uh different length scales uh decorrelation so a cell say in the     
50:51     
center of the array will look different from cells at the edge of the array just simply by virtue of them being in     
50:58     
different places being in different populations being far away from one another and what they're arguing here     
51:05     
though is that it's not a simple case of Decay from a source it's where you have     
51:10     
these regions that are sort of correlated and then regions that are uncorrelated so you might have cells     
51:17     
that are all in the same area that are uncorrelated because they're fundamentally different in terms of the     
51:24     
signals that they're receiving or the signals that they're emitting from other local areas in the array and so you'll     
51:32     
have these correlated and uncorrelated regions and this is uh you know where     
51:38     
you have these opposing forces of integration and segregation some parts of the tissue are being integrated some     
51:44     
parts are being segregated and that's how you form a pattern you have you know     
51:49     
if you have a mix of things at random some of those things have to be organized into clumps some of them have     
51:56     
to be brok broken up so you have to suppress some cells so that you can have     
52:01     
clumps and that's how you get this sort of pattern then they talk about uh not     
52:07     
local longdistance signal so they talk about these non-local causal     
52:13     
interactions among the cells constituting the VM pattern so longdistance signaling plays a crucial     
52:20     
role morphogenesis facilitating spatio temporal coordination among the parts of     
52:25     
the developing system some of the major sources of long-distance communication that have     
52:30     
been so far identified include diffusing morphogens and this is from of course chemical     
52:36     
morphogenesis where you have these signals that diffuse across um your you     
52:43     
know your pattern forming surface and that these morphogens interact and they     
52:49     
coll you know they're the uh Radiance Collide and you get these striping patterns or other types of boundaries     
52:56     
cellular protrusions tunneling nanot tubes maccrage networks as well as     
53:01     
bioelectric signal so all these things are kind of known as these longdistance communication sources so you get things     
53:09     
that communicate locally but also longdistance and so if you have long-distance communication you can have     
53:15     
things that are intermediate to Global and local pattern formation electric fields are also known     
53:23     
to play a role during development in the form of cell migration or what we call galvano taxis     
53:30     
proliferation and modulation of ion channels and so the question is could the electric field also facilitate     
53:36     
direct cellto cell communication especially at long distances even if it is weak so could we have this weak     
53:44     
electric field facilitate direct cellto cell communication but at long distances     
53:49     
instead of locally like what we are supposing with our neighborhoods and our local interactions     
53:56     
in the context of our model could the field catalyze the interactions among the components of the VM pattern despite     
54:03     
being orders of magnitude smaller about 1% than vman so in answering this     
54:09     
question they considered the measures that Express the degree and length of causal interactions between cells     
54:15     
facilitated by the field across space and time so they Define causal strength and causal distance that's talked about     
54:22     
in the methods causal strength being the absolute value of the derivative of the     
54:28     
DM which is the VM which is this potential of three representative target cells of the tissue at representative     
54:35     
time points greater than zero with respect to the VM of every cell at T equals z so basically looking at the     
54:43     
derivative of this uh VM parameter for     
54:48     
you know a subset of target cells looking forward in time and versus     
54:55     
looking at every cell and its potential at time zero so what is the time evolution of the signal and what is the     
55:03     
time Evolution locally of the signal so the causal strength should be if something happens you know t0 is sort of     
55:09     
your Baseline and then you move out in time and you say locally what is the     
55:15     
causal strength of you know how is whatever is happening at t0 effect     
55:21     
what's happening later and what is the strength of that causal relationship how's how's strong is it that one uh the     
55:28     
VM at one point is affecting the VM at another point and specific to certain cells so that's that's that's causal     
55:35     
strength and then causal distance is the distance corresponding to the highest causal strength averaged over target     
55:42     
cells in time and expressed in units of distance or M which I guess is meters um     
55:49     
which you know you can get a you can use something a lot smaller than that but I     
55:55     
know yeah anyways it's a unit of distance um causal strength quantifies the sensitivity of the VM of a cell to     
56:02     
small changes in the VM of another cell separated in space and time and causal     
56:07     
distance indicates the distance at which it occurs so causal distance of course is looking at this spatial aspect and     
56:17     
so uh this is where we want to average over our target cells and then in time and     
56:25     
look at the units of distance so it's basically like a spatial correlation between the cells and the     
56:32     
field so if you look at the center cell you can look at rings around that Center     
56:37     
cell and you average over that ring and you say what is the causal distance how     
56:43     
is this focal cell in the middle of the array affecting cells at different distances outward and so again if it's     
56:50     
at random you should see this Decay over space from the center cell the causal     
56:55     
distance should decrease as you go outward but you may not see that in a highly patterned shape or highly     
57:02     
patterned field you might see variation across the field and so that's what he's getting at with causal or they're     
57:07     
getting at with causal distance and then this is different than causal strength but they're     
57:16     
related so this is figure six causal strength and causal distance is a function of field range these red lines     
57:24     
here indicate the CS values the causal strength values and are plotted against     
57:29     
the left axis and the blue is the causal distance values um that are plotted     
57:36     
against the bright Y axis so you see the you know they do one of these graphs where they have two different y axes     
57:43     
causal strength being on the left the red causal distance being on the right the blue and you can see that in     
57:49     
these uh different examples they have they change the weights and they change the threshold and for different weights     
57:57     
as you get to higher weights you get these like these enhanced causal     
58:03     
strength and causal distance measures uh in this example here you get     
58:09     
it earlier in terms of you know in terms of the weights so you get it for lower     
58:15     
weights and so you know you can see the variation here basically this is an     
58:20     
example weak field sensitivity basically where causal strength and causal distance are flat     
58:27     
and then this is an example of strong field sensitivity here we already get these enhanced values okay so again they     
58:34     
go back to to sort of this idea of an organizer and that's what they're trying to get at and they ask could the     
58:42     
electric field facilitates such patterning the transient stimulation of a small part of the tissue and I guess     
58:49     
the answer is maybe um moreover several known morphogenetic patterning processes     
58:54     
and embryos adop linear and direct decoding strategy or most of the information about the pattern is     
59:00     
supplied by the morphogens or deduced using relatively simple interpretation     
59:06     
processes such as the French flag which is where you have these stripes in a field that get formed and the clock     
59:13     
wavefront mechanism or the clock and wavefront mechanism which is another model that involves the timing of waves     
59:22     
and so they're comparing it to these more traditional models and they ask could there be a more nonlinear complex     
59:29     
strategy where the initial information set ply by an organizer like entity is     
59:34     
coded and the system actively decodes it to generate the full pattern so is this     
59:40     
you know where the organizer is kind of giving it a template and then everything is decoded within the Dynamics of the     
59:48     
system or is is this just kind of you know an artifact of the data so that's     
59:54     
kind of what they're getting at here and their answer of course is that the model that they're showing here the results     
59:59     
that they're showing here suggests this type of sort of pre-patterning and then     
1:00:05     
amplification of the pre patterning and this is done by these bio electric     
1:00:14     
mechanisms so this is a very busy paper there's a lot of data in here a lot going on um looks like dick had to leave     
1:00:21     
but um yeah this so this is a very big paper and I think it you know kind of     
1:00:28     
gets into some of these issues not only of bioelectricity and its role in morphogenesis but also you know kind of     
1:00:36     
what what it is to be sort of a self-organized entity what are the steps that involve you know getting these sort     
1:00:43     
of self-organized structures in place and so they answer that by you know kind     
1:00:48     
of laying out this model uh doing some simulations and giving us I think a lot     
1:00:54     
of food for thought     
1:01:00     
so let me go to the chat here we have some things here uh I think dick and     
1:01:05     
Susan yeah so okay um dick said back to about 1900     
1:01:12     
in fish eggs I think he's referring to one of the earlier things that I was talking about Susan says do they take     
1:01:19     
into consideration the electric field in mitochondria yeah they didn't mention mitochondria I think this is more of a     
1:01:25     
general enzed electric field in the cell where you get these ion channels that     
1:01:30     
are set up uh you know you get this ION channel flux in the cell and they provide this balance and then you     
1:01:38     
measure sort of the overall electrical activity so whatever ion channels are     
1:01:44     
expressed in the membranes that allows for ION channel exchange and then that gives you     
1:01:49     
your large electrical gradient surrounding the mitochondria     
1:01:56     
yeah they don't get very much into intra intracellular stuff here this is just largely intracellular     
1:02:03     
stuff so dick says sounds like gobbledygook you know and then I know     
1:02:10     
he's not a fan of the uh morphogenetic field stuff so then Susan says put the electric     
1:02:17     
field information into console and model it well that's something yeah I mean like you could do that um I don't know     
1:02:23     
what program they use for this I'm not sure they're using like a standard program I think they're just setting up     
1:02:29     
these simulations there is a um I mean there's a lot more to the paper first of     
1:02:35     
all but and I don't want to give it like a short shrift in that sense but they do     
1:02:40     
set up these simulations um it's not clear what they're doing how they're doing this no     
1:02:47     
I'm I'm multitasking here Bradley but um which paper is this is this 11 paper     
1:02:53     
yeah this is Len In manica This is is a new preprint that they have let me get     
1:02:59     
the title for you yeah so previously they they have their own software for     
1:03:05     
um electrical bi bi electric cellular modeling yeah yeah it's it's called     
1:03:13     
Betsy oh right yeah Betsy yeah yeah it's very cool I mean     
1:03:19     
and you know yeah they they developed their own     
1:03:24     
tool to do that kind of um that kind of     
1:03:29     
python it is uh well I in Python I I can't remember     
1:03:38     
now if original is in C++ um but do think it's     
1:03:45     
python but check check Betsy yeah yeah that's it's a Betsy with two e's at the     
1:03:51     
end yeah it say I I remember we talked about this I think it might have been Saturday meeting but you know they yeah     
1:03:58     
they do have the specialized software for this how do you spell that uh bet     
1:04:04     
[Music] t     
1:04:12     
t so the paper two of them forget which one was     
1:04:19     
the earlier one which one's the later one but there's a there's a second um     
1:04:26     
sorry I'm in the car so I I would     
1:04:34     
tot oh so the T paper title is field mediated bioelectric basis of     
1:04:40     
morphogenetic pre patterning a computational study and this is just a new preprint that came so that sounds     
1:04:48     
awes I mean that that like like soon as I soon as I get uh kids dropped I will     
1:04:53     
be checking it out yeah yeah it's a huge paper so I just wanted to cover some of the stuff in it we talked oh really yeah     
1:05:01     
it's like when you say huge like well there's a lot of work in it a lot of complex graphs you have to dig into I     
1:05:09     
mean I I showed some but I didn't talk about like their significance um so yeah     
1:05:14     
it's it's like something to follow up on for sure okay awesome awesome yeah we     
1:05:20     
talked about synergetics which was interesting I don't think they talked about it in the in I don't think they actually     
1:05:27     
version yeah but there's definitely this aspect of like like U stigmergy and and     
1:05:33     
things we've talked about with respect to emergent systems where you have emerg     
1:05:39     
working and so I think they lay out the sort of the emergence aspect well too and kind well yeah you're mentioning     
1:05:47     
Edelman and and ton and spor yeah okay     
1:05:56     
like like they're not exactly Hawkins school but very     
1:06:03     
close sys yeah yeah oh yeah they have kind of     
1:06:08     
their yeah the stuff that they're doing with like integrated information and all of that yeah yeah it's it's you know     
1:06:18     
your is more like your was an actual student of Hawkins um     
1:06:26     
but you know like they're all all coming at it from just kind of similar you know     
1:06:35     
biophysics yeah yeah it's approach yeah yeah it's the same math and everything     
1:06:43     
yeah okay so that's uh that's what we have for today um now I know people are here     
1:06:51     
they might be interested in gck so we haven't talked about that yet today uh     
1:06:57     
but you know we'll be continuing with projects people have project ideas you know you're free to present them in the     
1:07:03     
meetings just just muted yourself     
1:07:10     
oh so yeah if you want to present a project idea you're free to present     
1:07:15     
those in the meetings um just tell me beforehand we can reserve some time for you um looks like we have um a message     
1:07:25     
here trying to get to the top anth this is one of the people in the meeting here     
1:07:31     
hey guys I spent the last week going through the uh graph neural networks codebase and getting familiar with stuff     
1:07:37     
like NCA and cmaes since I was not really familiar with them that's the stuff with neural     
1:07:43     
cellular autometa and the other uh the stuff that uh was forked last summer for     
1:07:51     
um the growing neural networks project so this this is there's a you know a lot of these things were forked from other     
1:07:57     
places so you have to get sort of some background in that to really work with it     
1:08:02     
effectively um uh still stuck a bit on how the training Loop Works uh but I've     
1:08:08     
reached out to Pocky to help me with it yeah Pocky of course did the growing neural networks and mul did the uh the     
1:08:16     
hypergraphs so if you're interested you know whatever whichever uh one you're interested in you know Pocky did one and     
1:08:24     
and uh M did the other but you know they're they're always willing to help out at least to answer     
1:08:30     
questions in terms of what they did last summer their experience so please reach     
1:08:35     
out if you want to you know they should be able to help you out um I wanted to     
1:08:41     
try and work on this issue in GitHub this is uh evog graph issue 27 which is     
1:08:48     
coding oriented and it seems to be stagnant as well I hope I'll be able to close that by this week and if it ends     
1:08:54     
up getting a assigned to me yeah okay um so this is the issue     
1:09:00     
here this is D graph issue 27 enhance and fix graph implementation for     
1:09:07     
Conformity and functionality so this was uh opened in on December 9 and I don't     
1:09:14     
know who uh I don't know who this opened this issue I I wasn't familiar with I     
1:09:21     
don't remember seeing this it must have come up I didn't pay too much attention to at the time but     
1:09:27     
basically um the graph class in a repository D graph growing GNN graph. py     
1:09:36     
requires several enhancements and fixes to ensure better functionality robustness and API Conformity so it goes     
1:09:43     
over the expected behaviors and then the proposed solution and additional     
1:09:49     
information so yeah uh issue 27 in daph I think that's um or in dvo yeah doog     
1:09:57     
graph I think that would be good to address if you can um please you know     
1:10:02     
follow the sort of the way we do things which is you know you can issue a poll request um and then we I mean I I'll     
1:10:10     
take a look at the poll request just make sure that you document what changes you're making and how you're addressing     
1:10:16     
the issue because I am not always familiar with a lot of the stuff going     
1:10:21     
on in the repository I'm not Hands-On in that Repository or as Hands-On as I'd     
1:10:26     
like to be so yeah so that sounds good and that would     
1:10:33     
actually be a good start um maybe you could build I don't know what you're interested in doing in that project but     
1:10:39     
you know the the idea basically in in these proposals is to propose something     
1:10:46     
that you think would be useful to any aspect of this so you can combine growing graph neural networks and     
1:10:54     
hypergraphs where you can focus on one or the other you can focus on extending     
1:10:59     
the results or you can focus on some sort of Maintenance it just has to be long     
1:11:04     
enough to be a gck project and how long that is is hard to say but you do go     
1:11:10     
through sort of the duration of gsop which is about 12 weeks and you figure     
1:11:16     
how much work would be good for a single week and you just kind of make that calculation then that's how much work     
1:11:21     
you would propose so if it's just like a simple fix you know a simple solving a     
1:11:27     
simple issue if the issues are really simple that's fine that's probably not a Gite project on its own but if you     
1:11:34     
extend that out and say okay let's build from that and let's try to you know maybe knock off a couple more issues     
1:11:41     
that might be needed or you know maybe updating things in the repositories or     
1:11:49     
you know you just have to think about the right amount of work for that and usually I let the students kind of     
1:11:55     
provide their own Solutions or provide their own sort of guidance on that I'm     
1:12:01     
always free to look at project proposals to see if they're good see if you're you     
1:12:06     
know that you've kind of gotten it in the right format that you're asking the right questions or that you're doing the     
1:12:14     
right amount of work so please don't hesitate to reach out okay yes all right thank you all     
1:12:23     
right so if there are no more questions or comments I think that's it for today again yeah let's follow up on this uh 11     
1:12:30     
and manica paper if if you want and I I know with Morgan you know I wanted to     
1:12:35     
remind him that I had brought up this business about uh organoids and how this     
1:12:41     
is something that could be useful in organized     
1:12:48     
research I got the paper as soon as I get yeah get to it last yeah yeah uh I     
1:12:54     
think Al had something to say uh sir actually could you please     
1:13:01     
hear that modernish neural networks is evolutional clear that paper yeah yeah     
1:13:08     
actually um I'll share it in the slack and I'll share it in the like in the     
1:13:13     
description of the YouTube video which I usually do um but I can share the actual paper in     
1:13:19     
slack because it's a neural computation paper may or may not be accessible yeah yes     
1:13:26     
right right well thank you for attending today and uh talk to you next     
1:13:34     
week take care
