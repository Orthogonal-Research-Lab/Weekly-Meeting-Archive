## TRANSCRIPTS   
     
0:06     
hello hello hi how are     
0:11     
you uh I am so I'm from India I want to give a     
0:18     
little introduction about like know my one of my friend meul Arora he just gave     
0:25     
me the link to join this meeting so I want to give little introduction about     
0:31     
like why am I interested to join in this project and uh so I want to give a     
0:37     
little details about that all right that sounds good yeah go ahead so yeah so     
0:44     
basically I comed my bachelors in uh so vnr so one of the Indian Institute so     
0:52     
where uh I did some B in the medical imaging so during that time uh computer     
0:58     
vision Medical Imaging was very much intriguing to me so uh what what I did     
1:05     
is I've tried to understand how these neural networks developed for like the     
1:11     
systems like the neural network suppose so how they have approached and uh how     
1:17     
is this biological Vision actually fundamentally processing and I wanted to     
1:23     
understand there is a is there a relationship between like uh biological vision and the computer vision what     
1:29     
approaches that previously it has been done so uh I was no uh So currently I am in     
1:38     
doing my masters in trip Hyderabad under profor B so where I'm trying to     
1:43     
understand uh you know uh human cognition specific to how the visual     
1:49     
data from the given visual data how the uh brain actually it works it starts     
1:55     
from like retina there and then lgan and it goes back to visual CeX so I'm trying     
2:01     
to understand uh so how the mechanisms like uh how these intered neurons have     
2:08     
been developed and uh how the actual the current neural networks are like working     
2:15     
so I'm trying to bridge between these two so my interest lies in that and I     
2:20     
have studied a little bit uh in principles of neural design the way they     
2:26     
have you know created uh no sudden good principles the book by uh uh Peter     
2:33     
Sterling and Simon l so my little interest lies in this     
2:43     
areas yeah and have seen the like uh know from that book I got inspired you     
2:50     
know they start from like simple small uh you know this n c Elegance where it     
2:57     
has like you know smaller structure of neuron but it uh how it     
3:03     
environmentally it actually know Works similar to that of having a 32 neurons     
3:09     
how is it able to you know actively participate in the environment and how the behavioral changes happens in human     
3:16     
cognition it becomes a larger scale so I am trying to understand so like how the     
3:23     
neuronal connections are processed in like you know human brain different organisms and yeah so likeing computer     
3:31     
vision how the computer line of is and how biological vision is so this is like     
3:38     
par mind yeah that sounds great um yeah so     
3:46     
we we've done a number of things in those areas um we're interested of     
3:52     
course in seans connectomes and see elan's development both in terms of the     
3:57     
connect element morphogenesis and then linking that to computational     
4:02     
models and um yeah we've done some work on comparing uh biological networks and     
4:10     
neural artificial networks neural networks so um yeah we should get in     
4:16     
touch a little bit more so yeah it's good and then you know our group we have people like Susan who are interested in     
4:22     
developmental biology in Morgan who does a lot of neuromodeling and you know he     
4:28     
has a background neuro IM in of course M does a lot of stuff     
4:33     
with uh networks and we have a lot of people who you know can you can talk to as well in     
4:41     
those different areas okay yeah that's good thank you for the introduction     
4:49     
again right um yes welcome soan welcome M     
4:55     
Susan Morgan any other things before we get started     
5:01     
or any other     
5:10     
updates okay we had some things in the chat oh just     
5:15     
some okay um yeah so like I said this is uh I     
5:23     
you know the Google summer of code period is coming up I oh there we go     
5:28     
thank you I sent um some messages or I sent the people at     
5:37     
incf a description of the projects actually there's only one project for d     
5:43     
one but like for our general group that I'm leading or I would be     
5:48     
mentoring uh and I don't know we're pretty early in that process but you know we're going to try     
5:55     
to follow up on the projects from last year that means that we'll have some some based for the hyper networks hyper     
6:02     
graphs some based for the growing gnn's and maybe some combination of the two so     
6:09     
we'll have to see you know what people come up with on that and everything comes out of the     
6:16     
repository that we've been working from that's the daph     
6:21     
repository uh that's a github.com and then of course we have we have the Dil     
6:27     
learner organization and then the D positive so everything will be found     
6:34     
there okay um let's get started so today I want to talk about     
6:40     
two things I found two papers uh the first one is this paper     
6:46     
and this is I guess it's some sort of theoretical comment that I don't know what Journal it looks like it's supposed     
6:53     
to be in a journal at some point but this was put on the archive uh around the end of last last     
7:00     
year uh this is uh Jesus Marco ducas from uh Spain yes they're from an     
7:09     
Institute of physics in Spain and its title was from worms to     
7:14     
mice homeostasis may be all you need which is you know the if you're familiar     
7:20     
with the machine learning literature there was an initial paper uh called attention is all you     
7:27     
need and then everyone kind of did a play on that title so that's what they're referencing there and then this     
7:34     
is you know worms to micis is a cross species comparison of what they're     
7:40     
calling homeostasis and the point is is that homeostasis is an explanatory     
7:48     
Factor uh so let's let's read the abstract and see what they're kind of getting at     
7:54     
here so this in this brief ins speculative commentary we expl ideas     
8:00     
inspired by neural networks and machine learning proposing that a simple neural X or Motif exclusive or Motif it's the     
8:09     
exclusive or U uh logic gate involving     
8:14     
both excitatory and inhibitory connections May provide the basis for Relevant modop plasticity in neural     
8:20     
circuits and living organisms with homeostat homeostasis as the sole     
8:26     
guiding principle so they're going to do I guess is look at different uh your     
8:31     
networks in different organisms and then look at this look for this X or     
8:38     
Motif and then it this uh includes both excitatory and inhibitory connections     
8:45     
and that sort of the basis for all these different     
8:50     
connectomes this xor this xor Motif simply signals the discrepancy between     
8:56     
incoming signals and reference signals so this is where you have this logic gate at this uh in this circuit where     
9:05     
you have this ability to sort of figure out the difference between incoming and     
9:10     
reference signals and that's why you have this Motif so it's s of some functional purpose and again this is     
9:17     
just the way that they're describing it it's not that the brain is implementing some sort of computational     
9:25     
motif like as as you know it's just kind of the way we can describe it not     
9:31     
necessarily that there's an inherent thing about that um about that     
9:36     
computational war um thereby providing a basis for a     
9:42     
loss function learning Neal circuits and at the same time regulating homeostasis by halting the propagation     
9:49     
of these incoming signals so they go on to say the cormo uses a 4:1 ratio of excitatory to     
9:57     
inhibitory neurons and supports broader neural patterns such as the well-known Winner Takes all mechanism or WTA     
10:05     
mechanism we examine the prevalence of The exor Motif in the published connectum of various organisms with     
10:13     
increased complexity or increasing complexity and found that it ranges from tens and     
10:19     
celegans to millions in several drop and neuropils and more than tens of millions     
10:25     
in M V1 visual cortex so this is where you have like     
10:30     
these motifs you can look at the connectomes of course celegans is the     
10:35     
smallest it's about 300 neurons roph neurop pills which include thousands of     
10:43     
neurons and then tens of millions of neurons and mouse V1 visual cortex so or     
10:49     
you have a lot more them cells than that so you have tens of millions of these Motif in visual     
10:55     
cortex um we'll see if they propose it at Scales I don't think you can really say much from maybe a couple of data     
11:02     
sets but suffice it to say the more neurons you have the greater number of     
11:07     
more keep you if validated our hypothesis identifies two of the the three key     
11:14     
components and analogy to machine learning the architecture of Theos function so this is where we look to     
11:22     
these connectomes we look for these computational motifs they allow for information     
11:28     
processing locally in the in the network they then have this these     
11:33     
attributes of say like uh like a sort of a loss function and then also some other     
11:40     
type of comparator role in in neural computation and then that's like     
11:48     
analogous to what we see in machine learning models and the way that handles learning so we can assume that that's a     
11:53     
learning mechanism in those connectomes so we have the architect     
11:59     
tecture loss function and we propose that a relevant type of biological neuroplasticity is simply driven by a     
12:06     
basic control of regulatory system which is persisted and adaptive despite the     
12:11     
increased complexity of organisms throughout Evolution so again as we get     
12:16     
these different size connecton we have this neural rule     
12:21     
that's sort of you know constant across these um connectomes so I think this is     
12:29     
a nice paper because it's it's short and it lays out this hypothesis which is     
12:34     
always you know brevity is always better but it also gives like these comparisons     
12:40     
across different um connectives     
12:46     
so the first thing to do is Define homeostasis so homeostasis is a general     
12:52     
term that can be defined as the ability or tendency of a living organism cell or     
13:00     
group so in this case we're interested in a group of cells a network of cells     
13:07     
so this network has a tendency to maintain the     
13:12     
conditions within it at the same level despite changes in the conditions around     
13:18     
it so this means that when your connectome is challenged by its     
13:23     
environment and especially in this case by some learning task if the organism     
13:29     
needs to learn something then the uh connectone has to change and has to     
13:35     
encode that information but the problem is it can't change too much because then     
13:40     
it you know it it uh falls out of equilibrium I guess the functional aspects of it so you know you think     
13:48     
about that at the level of synapses weights of the synapses have to change and when they you know but you     
13:55     
don't want to disrupt you know all the things that the work has learned before or it's its     
14:02     
General     
14:07     
function uh in our Saturday meeting which is um our Saturday morning neuros Sim     
14:14     
meeting Morgan and I were talking about this paper where they introduced they use     
14:21     
spiking neural networks and introduced the concept of not just weight matrices     
14:27     
for a neural network but uh like delay matrices or temporal lag matrices and I     
14:35     
think given this sort of mention of H homeostasis that's worth going back to think about that you know their networks     
14:41     
aren't just about um you know con we uh connection weeks and and looking at how     
14:48     
those change through learning but there's also a lot of temporal delay that occurs and especially in circuits     
14:56     
where you're trying to select a inhibit things and selectively um you know reinforce things     
15:05     
that this can be like you know an important mechanism so you want to be robust to     
15:11     
fluctuations in the environment undue change but also the state of internal     
15:18     
balance which goes back of course to Canon and talking about homeostasis as     
15:25     
this General mechanism for physiology so there's this internal balance again in the Network that has to be     
15:32     
maintained so that's that's homeostasis however in the context of Neuroscience     
15:38     
in addition to conditions at key levels such as intracellular or calcium concentration the term also refers of     
15:45     
the equilibrium achieved in the propagation of electrical and chemical activity preventing unstable conditions     
15:53     
such as neuro hyperactivity so basically something like uh having a seizure where     
15:59     
there's uncontrolled uh excitatory signals sent across a certain     
16:05     
part of the brain and and you get seizures instead of normal function so you want to be able to apparently what     
16:12     
happens in the brain is you get this inhibition you get this excitation and there has to be a balance of the two in     
16:18     
order to get proper function so that means that these networks have to have motifs that enable     
16:24     
the sort of regulation of this balance and so that's what they're kind of talking about also with respect to     
16:32     
homeostasis so they had another short commentary um this is the link here     
16:38     
reference to we'll get to that in a minute we presented a basic neurom Motif     
16:43     
composed of a few excitatory neurons and one inhibitory neuron cor responding to     
16:50     
seans uh which is basically you'd find this neurom Motif and C elegance and     
16:57     
showed that it can implement it an exor switch exclusive or switch uh such that when it's compared     
17:06     
comparing to input signals its output is non zero only if these signals are     
17:11     
different so this is exclusive or so you have two input signals you compare the two input signals you have to give an     
17:18     
output the output is either zero or it's non zero if it's     
17:25     
zero then you know this means that the two input signals are same if it's non zero that means it's     
17:32     
different so if you have like a zero and a one passing into this logic gate then     
17:39     
you get an input of non zero or one when the signals are different if the signals     
17:44     
are the same then you go to zero okay so this basically you might     
17:51     
get like if you can replace the zero and the one with inhibition and excitation     
17:57     
then that's basically the motif uh we also described how such an X or     
18:02     
Motif can be used in in a computational neural network as the core of a basic     
18:08     
Auto incur when trained using the so-called liquid time constraint or liquid time constants neural network     
18:15     
framework LTC frame uh in this new note we extend the previous implementation to the case of     
18:21     
spiking neurons so again we're dealing with spiking neurons not just uh like a     
18:28     
standard network uh and explore in more detail     
18:34     
the presence of this exoro teeth in different organisms using the available     
18:39     
open data for their connectos so there are number of open data sets for the new people we know or     
18:46     
the have people been around here enough know that there are all these open data     
18:51     
sets for connectomes you can download them and reconstruct a connecto but you     
18:57     
know that only gives you the connection it doesn't give you any more information than that you can then play around with     
19:04     
the connect the connection data uh some neurophysiological data and actually come up with some     
19:11     
interesting uh things about the connecto so first we examine the     
19:16     
celegans connectum again requiring the explicit ex Motif to inhibit connections     
19:23     
then we look at the recently published connectum of dropa there are several connectum of     
19:29     
dropa for different parts of the drop brain and you know those are uh     
19:35     
available they're much larger size than the SE elegance conecto and you know     
19:40     
people uh usually analyze those pie meal they usually look at say     
19:47     
like you know there's usually some sensory connecto for example and they'll     
19:52     
look at that you know because looking at the entire connecto across the dof of     
19:58     
brain is a little hard uh to really get any insight out it at least at this     
20:03     
point so you know you want to look at the different connecton in different ways finally we also examine the     
20:09     
connectome describing the V1 visual cortex and mice and this is available this is actually much bigger than even     
20:15     
the dropa connecto uh where the subconnect dos and but this is very specific to his H     
20:22     
function visual processing and of course we just talked about that um with uh     
20:29     
Lilith um and how you know that's has some sort of Correspondence at least     
20:36     
these people think it does to artificial in their own networks and there are a lot of methods you can use to look at     
20:42     
that but what they're doing here is they're looking at all these different biological connectomes and looking for     
20:47     
those computational motives we conclude by discussing the potential relevance of     
20:52     
this very simple XR Motif is the core piece for configuring biologically     
20:58     
viable computational n networks so this this previous     
21:05     
commentary is reference to and that's here implementing engrams for our     
21:10     
machine learning perspective xor is a basic Motif and this is also an archive     
21:18     
paper this is the paper here um so this is where they kind of get     
21:25     
into this using the single model in celegans um and then kind of thinking     
21:33     
about autoencoders as sort of the comparator for this so that's the that's maybe     
21:42     
worth reading as well okay so this is an image of the basic xor     
21:47     
Motif this is where we have our different uh sort of cell types and     
21:53     
connections so we have um I guess our E1 E2 E3 and E4 cells are excitatory     
22:02     
cells and then our inhibitory inter neuron which is in the middle     
22:07     
inh and then the output at the right which is EXO so we have two different     
22:12     
types of connection we have the excitory connection green the inhibitory Connection in red E1 goes to ex and it     
22:21     
sends an excitatory connection to the inhibitory in neuron and E2 E3 sends an excitatory connection to     
22:30     
the inhibitory inter neuron in E4 then the inhibitory inter neuron as     
22:35     
it's activated by the excitatory connection sends an inhibitory connection shown in red to both E2 and     
22:44     
E4 then E2 and E4 sum those excitatory and inhibitory     
22:51     
connections and then send this excitatory connection both of them to     
22:56     
EXO so it has to be the same state going to exort to be     
23:02     
activated so if this you know and then like we we talked about with time delays     
23:07     
the time delay might play a role in this because if the inhibitory signal is sent     
23:14     
before the excitatory signal to E2 and E4 it might result in a different outcome to the exor node and you know     
23:23     
produce a different outcome it may not sa for for example produce a nonzero     
23:32     
output to XO so that's the structure of the motif what they're arguing is that     
23:37     
they find these in connectomes where we have this mix this balance of excitatory and inhibitory connections and that they     
23:44     
give this output that is then useful to the rest of the connecto so tiny groups of cells     
23:51     
connected in a certain way or certain types of connections with certain Outlets     
24:04     
so like I said these spiking neural networks uh they have they their spiking     
24:10     
patterns for the EXO uh EXO Motif neurons looks like they're using the     
24:15     
Brian 2 platform for doing these simulations so Brian is a a sort of an     
24:21     
electrophysiological simulation platform and you can use this to model spiking neurons     
24:32     
this is uh some variations on the uh xor Motif so this is a comparison of a basic     
24:40     
strict xor Motif on the left and an example of a virtual one on the right     
24:47     
this includes additional connections among the nodes strict motifs are defined as an isomorphism between the     
24:54     
motif and a subgraph in the connectum OR motifs are defined as     
25:02     
monomorphisms so this is uh kind of a tricky point about modeling but     
25:08     
isomorphism is where you should have a on toone correspondence between say like the bi     
25:14     
if you're looking at a biological system like a connectum and you're looking at a model like this then it should be a     
25:21     
strict one toone model you should be able to find this configuration on the     
25:26     
left in biological connectone and it should give you the same     
25:33     
outputs it's a model but it should apply to the real world in a one toone     
25:40     
way these virtual motifs um are a little bit different     
25:46     
because you can modify them in the model and they basically match the behavior of     
25:53     
the uh thing that you're observing in the biology so here they add a couple     
25:58     
they they have these connections a little bit more detailed they're uh     
26:04     
recurrent connections from you know in the strict model we're going from left to right in     
26:11     
the virtual model we're going from left to right and right to left with additional connections additional     
26:18     
inhibitory connections and so on and so forth so we might see a a motif wired in     
26:25     
the way that it is on the left but it doesn't have the same Behavior has a little bit more complex behavior and so     
26:31     
we might assume that there're different connections or different things going on and so that's the difference here so     
26:39     
they they have these virtual motifs and the stricter motifs that they also     
26:46     
identifi then they they propos this different Motif here with six     
26:51     
interconnected neurons one of them inhibitory and eight edges so this is where we have our same     
26:59     
configuration in terms of cells as we did in the strict model the isomorphic     
27:04     
model but in this case we have it's wired a bit differently and uh you know so some of     
27:11     
the configurations overlap with the strip XR Motif but it's a different type of motif     
27:19     
and so you might find different motifs you know like if you take a connecto     
27:24     
like celegans you might find examples of the strict motif you might find this as an alternative     
27:30     
Motif you might find the monomorphic example as another type of motif and     
27:36     
then you know the idea when you look at motifs in networks is that you find     
27:41     
these very small groups of neurons connected in a certain way a lot of times people will do network analysis by     
27:49     
looking for things like triangular motifs or other types of very small sets of connections you know that that occur     
27:56     
again and again in the network and then they might count up how many of those motifs they find and where they find     
28:02     
them in the network and then that tells them something about information processing in the     
28:08     
network it might tell them something about the topology that might tell them something about the robustness of the     
28:15     
network and it might tell them something about like the sort of the small     
28:20     
worldness or the uh the connectivity of the netor so there are a lot of things     
28:26     
you can tell from motifs it's a very small set of neurons a very small set of nodes but if you look at these and they     
28:33     
repeat again and again you can kind of piece together what the global State should look like or you know how this     
28:41     
small group of nodes affects the global     
28:46     
State yeah so then they have an example of fold feedback and asymmetric feedback     
28:52     
basically that functionally they can either be sort of symmetric or asymmetric     
28:58     
and then they get it you know so that's like kind of from celegans and they're doing this theoretical work then they     
29:04     
look at uh the X Motif from groph and so now they're extending it to a larger     
29:10     
connectone and they're actually looking because now you have different types of     
29:15     
neurotransmitter that you don't have in celegans um and you can kind of they're     
29:20     
using these Brian simulations to get at this sort of stuff they have you know     
29:27     
now they're looking at different neurop pill and they're looking at the number of neurons in each neurop pill the     
29:33     
number of connections and they actually enumerate the number of EXO motifs which um you know vary across     
29:41     
different neurop pills so for some neurop pill relative to the number connections are quite     
29:47     
abundant versus uh sometimes you don't have any of these exor motifs in certain     
29:53     
neurop so that suggests that there's maybe a functional difference between     
30:02     
different uh then they go to the mice the mouse example I think     
30:08     
is this one this is where I guess     
30:20     
they okay so they do then they do some work in mice and they kind of get into the statistics of that     
30:28     
and so you know again these are very different connectomes different size connectomes and we're just looking at     
30:35     
the presence or absence of these motifs and so if we do that we can actually find     
30:40     
them and they operate you know among according to the same     
30:45     
principles and so they must there must be some uh larger sort of function for     
30:52     
these these motifs um and so and again you know uh     
30:58     
so they say the analysis of the presence of the exoro teeth in very different connectomes from mice indicates a     
31:06     
potential interest of this explicit configuration involving excited or in     
31:11     
inhibitory neurons already suggested by the previous results considering three     
31:16     
and four node motifs and different connectomes and also by the importance of this winter tle circuit uh     
31:24     
topology so however the analysis presented here     
31:30     
proposes that the exor motif May provide a common basis for better understanding     
31:35     
the importance of EI balance or excitatory inory balance for homeostasis     
31:41     
and probably its relevance is a direct feedback signal for learning implementing a kind of basic loss     
31:48     
function so there's a whole literature on homeostasis and EI balance that they     
31:54     
um are kind of referencing here um and     
31:59     
they don't put it in this section but there are P you know people have looked at this uh both sort of     
32:05     
neurophysiologically and then computationally um although the relevance of computation at the     
32:11     
dendritic level is well established these exor motifs May provide the key to computation at the     
32:17     
neuronal circuit level this may be the case in Mouse primary visual cortex     
32:23     
where a glif network based on the same connecto as we studied provides firing rates comparable to those obtained from     
32:30     
biologically detailed models using Nest which is a uh platform uh the integration of     
32:38     
inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the motif suggests a different approach to solving the exor problem than other     
32:45     
proposals using spiking neurons so this is where you know we can     
32:52     
look at this with using spiking neurons but we can look at this using other methods as well if we're comparing ing     
32:58     
it with neural networks those you know we can model those as spiking networks     
33:03     
but ultimately you know we they you know we we can use other models     
33:09     
to to sort of validate this okay so the possibility that a     
33:15     
simple regulatory control mechanism can also drive a quite sophisticated task     
33:20     
such as learning is yet to be confirmed by understanding how much XR feedback is reinjected and used to promote     
33:27     
plasticity so that's why they were doing these Rec current uh models as well just     
33:32     
to show that you know you can have this uh Motif as a static thing but in you     
33:39     
know you need some recurrence to promote plasticity and learning and so that's why they did that     
33:46     
because they want to show sort of how this would work over time but it seems computational feasible based on the     
33:52     
well-known results of using random feedback to train computational nors     
33:58     
so this is where they kind of go into learning but then you know they they stop short of     
34:04     
saying that they can demonstrate learn nevertheless I think it's a really nice paper because they kind of get into     
34:11     
this FR species comparison they get into the motifs and what they should look     
34:17     
like and then they get into the functional aspects as well so do we have any questions or     
34:26     
comments that's a would like to understand what is neurop pills I'm like     
34:32     
new so neurop pill is uh any area of the nervous system composed of mostly     
34:39     
unmated axons dendrites and wheel cell processes that forms a synaptically     
34:46     
dense region containing a relatively low number of cell bodies so we have uh you     
34:53     
know these groups of uh unmated axons Androids and wheel cells that form a     
35:00     
synaptically dense regions so you have cell bodies there synapses and it's just     
35:05     
this area where uh you know we can basically get a lot of     
35:12     
connectivity so I mean this is like I don't know if like that makes sense um but let's see if I can find an     
35:21     
image here so you know examples of the neurop     
35:26     
pill is and this would be in the mamum brain is the outer neocortex layer baral     
35:34     
cortex inner plexiform layer and outer plexiform layer and the GL uh GL uh glui     
35:43     
of the Cabell uh these are all found in humans with the exceptional Barrel cortex which     
35:48     
is find found in rats and mice with many species of counterparts similar to our regions of neurop and course sople it's     
35:56     
going to be completely different regions but basically they're these connection dense regions in the     
36:04     
brain and so um they so yeah they have diverse Ro     
36:09     
roles they sort of serve as way stations for information flowing from the     
36:15     
olfactory receptor neurons of the olfactory cortex again we can come back to it     
36:20     
later um second thing I wanted to talk about was this paper this is uh shifting gears     
36:27     
now to organ organogenesis and tissue formation and things like     
36:34     
that so this is a paper in biology     
36:40     
letters and it's called metabolic complementation between cells drives the     
36:46     
evolution of tissues and orans and this is uh the     
36:54     
halev uh de Francisco and w bner um they all sort of evolutionary     
37:02     
biologists developmental biologists     
37:08     
okay so let's read the abstract first although evolutionary transitions     
37:15     
of individuality have been extensively theorized little attention has been paid to the or origin of     
37:21     
levels organization within organisms that's a mouthful um so basically     
37:28     
they're looking at levels of organization and they're looking at this     
37:33     
thinking about this kind of how you might think of evolutionary transitions so you know you have individual     
37:40     
cells and somehow those firms sell populations so you have this sort of     
37:46     
transition of multicellularity then for multicellularity you go to some sort of     
37:52     
functional Next Step which is to have organs or have     
37:57     
groups functionally distinct groups of cells then you have organs that support     
38:04     
sort of a homeostasis so you have you know different cell types in say a tissue or     
38:11     
an organ and then you have those organs grouped into organ systems tissue     
38:18     
systems and then organisms so you're building up from single cells and you're building up these layers of complexity     
38:25     
and you know that doesn't happen happen just out of you know nothing there has     
38:31     
to be there have to be these transitions between say like a bunch of cells and then like a population of     
38:39     
cells or a multicellular cellular Collective people have studied this in terms of uh evolutionary transitions but     
38:48     
in development we don't really haven't really taken that idea and moved it into the developmental realm so that's what     
38:54     
they're going to do here how and why do specialized cells become organized in a special into a     
39:00     
specialized tissue or an organ what's SP is a transition in organizational level     
39:06     
in cases where the function is already present in constituent CS so you know this is where     
39:13     
again you have these uh this certain level of complexity and then you're     
39:19     
moving to another level of complexity and sometimes you're sort of recapitulating function in other words     
39:27     
you know we we are tempted to think that the reason why we have tissues instead     
39:33     
of individual cells is because it confers some sort of functional Advantage but it may be that the cells     
39:40     
are already doing those things it's just that forming a tissue might not have an immediate     
39:45     
benefit functional but it might actually build upon like you know complexity so     
39:52     
it's you know it's hard to say why these transitions happen     
39:58     
but we first of all want to identify those transitions are there and then figure out you know how they kind of     
40:04     
happened and why so these are the kind of questions they're asking and people won really     
40:11     
have very good answers for them so they propose a hypothesis for this kind of evolutionary transition based on two     
40:18     
features of cellular metabolism the first is metabolic constraints on     
40:23     
functional performance and then the the second is the capacity for metabolic     
40:30     
complementation between paranal and supporting cells so basically if you have like     
40:38     
cells that are sort of doing their job there are certain metabolic constraints     
40:45     
that prevent them from really kind of reaching an energe they reach an energetic threshold and they can't do     
40:52     
any they they can't really uh they have a certain limit to their functional contr     
40:58     
but if you build this sort of multicellular system this tissue this organ then it enhances their ability to     
41:07     
do uh metabolic things and it removes his metabolic constraints and then the second that the     
41:14     
capacity for complementation between different parts of the tissue organ is     
41:21     
increased so this is where we have the sort of you know cells in some     
41:27     
supporting things that things that support the cells and it gives the cells like this sort of ecosyst to live inside     
41:35     
and it then increases their function as well or their metabolic capacity as     
41:42     
well these features suggest a scenario whereby pre-existing specialized cell types are integrated into     
41:50     
tissues when changes to the internal or external environment favor offloading     
41:55     
metabolic burdens from a primary specialized cell type onto supporting     
42:01     
cells so this is where we have uh you know pre-existing cell types     
42:08     
kind of not integrated into a tissue then they get integrated into a     
42:14     
tissue when changes the environment um you know you don't want     
42:21     
you can really have you know really highly specialized s and they can exist kind of in a network of cells and they     
42:28     
don't really have to form an integrated tissue but sometimes you want to offload     
42:35     
that from the primary cell types to other types of cells so sometimes you know you want to have like three     
42:41     
different cell types managing you know energy balance or something like we saw in the last paper if you need a certain     
42:49     
circuit that balances excite excitatory connections with inhibitory connections you know you     
42:56     
could have bunch of cells that do that independently but integrating that into connective integrating that into brain     
43:04     
tissue might be more advantageous for replicating that Motif     
43:09     
or maintaining that Motif and maybe maintaining learning over     
43:15     
time so offloading metabolic gens is a good way to put that     
43:20     
because you know doing specialized functions requires a lot of energy     
43:26     
requires a high degree of metabolic stability and of course cells are you know sometimes     
43:33     
they reach a certain amount of metabol metabolic stability and if their metabolism is too high they can become     
43:39     
cancerous they can um you know undergo apotosis things like that so if we can     
43:45     
offload that capacity onto supporting cells we can preserve the cells and keep     
43:52     
them from uh doing bad things so this really kind of speaks to how like you     
44:01     
know in evolutionary transitions we often think about say like individual     
44:07     
cells forming a collective of cells that do something and you know they sort of     
44:14     
give up certain things about their cell identity to the collective to different     
44:20     
other cells they offload things um and the transition to eukaryotic cells for     
44:26     
example there were organel that would you know offload their ability to be a     
44:32     
independent organism to the the eukaryotic cell um so that they could     
44:39     
survive as you know specialized units within the UK carotic cell so that's     
44:45     
kind of what they're thinking here and that's of course an evolutionary transition which means that you have You     
44:50     
observe this large scale change in the structure of these cells from you know a     
44:56     
bunch of cells that are dividing to this functional unit okay so we illustrate this process     
45:04     
of super functionalization using the nervous system and the pancreas as     
45:11     
examples so in order to understand this they talk about different types of evolutionary     
45:17     
transition and that you know there's this aspect of looking at this problem     
45:23     
as a evolutionary transition um so they actually talk     
45:28     
about some examples from biology here and a lot of     
45:36     
times you know you have sort of you know functions and you want to acquire new     
45:42     
functions but in a lot of these transitions you already have that function and you're just trying to     
45:48     
figure out a more efficient way to do it so uh they talk about how uh new     
45:56     
traits are associated with an alpha function a lot of times in biology however many organs perform functions     
46:03     
that existed prior to the origin of the organ so for example cells that produce     
46:08     
Digestive and detoxifying enzymes in the early branching Pates predate the     
46:14     
origins of the liver and pancreas so this is where we have this     
46:20     
function of digesting and detoxifying uh things and we we have have that those     
46:27     
sorts of functions before we have a liver or a pancreas so liver and a pancreas are basically just more     
46:34     
efficient ways of doing this perhaps but it involves cells kind of becoming a     
46:40     
collective and building this organ another example is neural cells that predate the central nervous system     
46:48     
and specific Endocrine cells that predate endocr so before the central nervous     
46:54     
system in in um in basil organisms that didn't have a     
47:00     
central nervous system there are examples that we have today of organisms that have say a nerve net or they have     
47:08     
they express synaptic proteins but they don't have uh neurons or synapses or     
47:15     
they're you know they have cells that communicate electronically but they're not     
47:20     
neurons those off sort of perform the functions of like you know neurons or     
47:28     
network neurons that are in a central nervous system but do very similar things so a central nervous system is in     
47:35     
Innovation that occurs at a certain point in evolution you have sort of you     
47:42     
know remnants of the ancestral condition where you don't have a central nervous     
47:47     
system but you have other solutions to that that you know so the question is     
47:53     
why did we EV why did we evolve a central nervous system and why do we see it in so many organisms the answer is     
47:59     
because of this sort of evolutionary transition there was some evolutionary transition at some point in evolution     
48:05     
and it was uh successful in terms of processing information in providing this     
48:12     
sort of means for Behavior so that's again another example     
48:18     
and then of course the endocrine example so these observations imply that the origins of some Novelties are not     
48:25     
associated with the origin of function with so that means that the origins of     
48:31     
the Novelties the origins of these systems of these specialized tissue systems and organ systems aren't really     
48:38     
associated with function instead they just arise by the integration of functionality so in other     
48:46     
words it's not the function itself it's integrating the different cells in the     
48:51     
functionally integrated networks so again there's this higher level unit     
48:57     
that forms maybe it does things more efficiently but there is this offloading     
49:02     
between cell types so that's over time certain SP cell types become specialized     
49:08     
for what they do best and then they inte they operate in this integrated     
49:14     
unit and again I think ukog Genesis is probably a good example of that um at     
49:20     
the cellular level so you have organel that form a cell that's uh you know sort     
49:26     
of the evolutionary transition from say procaryotic cells um so okay so this raises new     
49:35     
questions how and why do specializ cells become organized into a tissu order what     
49:40     
SPS a transition from cells to tissues when the function is already present so     
49:45     
these are two questions that you know you might ask uh the first is that how     
49:51     
do you get these specializ cells to become associated and into this integrated     
49:57     
tissue organ and you know the answer to that might be that they're living in association and they eventually form     
50:04     
this unit and it just becomes sort of this integrated you know tightly     
50:10     
integrated thing over time and we don't know the answer that's what we're trying to find out and then     
50:17     
what's SP as a transition from cells to tissues when the function is already present which is a good question because     
50:23     
you don't really have maybe there's uh selective pressure for maybe a more     
50:29     
efficient system but not for that system itself so it's really kind of think you     
50:35     
know we want to figure this out we kind of have to model um a system of cells     
50:43     
and present these different scenarios they talk a little about metabolic     
50:48     
constraints how you know there these metabolic constraints on single cells and having this you know population or     
50:55     
group of cells acting collectively can you know reduce     
51:01     
these constraints for any one cell type so um cellular metabolism which are the     
51:08     
basis of these metabolic constraints refer to chemical reactions providing     
51:13     
free energy and biomass each cell can only generate a finite amount of cellular energy by utilizing a limited     
51:20     
number of metabolic pathways therefore augmenting a cellular function or in producing a new function     
51:28     
reduces the metabolic resources available for other Pathways and cellular need such as self-maintenance     
51:35     
so this is this is a stochiometric constraint stochiometry is just the balance of different molecules in     
51:42     
balance of their production so uh the an     
51:48     
example of a stoy gomet constraint is where you have a molecule of glucose     
51:54     
which can only be used once so you mean when you have like a you know when you     
52:00     
have a store of glucose molecules see you have a thousand glucose molecules you can only use those once so you only     
52:06     
have so much glucose for a thousand reactions or so so this is the the idea     
52:12     
that you can't do any more work given the amount of uh metabolism you can     
52:19     
do and so this if you're living as a single cell then there's that constraint if you're living in a in an organ or     
52:26     
tissue then you can distribute what the requirements across different cells so     
52:32     
the sto geometry essentially becomes the the count of molecules becomes larger     
52:38     
and you can do more uh you can do more work apparently     
52:44     
so um such trade-offs are often invoked to explain the metabolic shifts in     
52:49     
energy and biomass production and high glucose and oxygen availability and     
52:54     
unicellular organisms in tumor cells so eukaryotic cells invest most of     
53:01     
their metabolic resources in self-maintenance and performance of service functions rather than     
53:07     
biomass so really there you know where whereas in a single cell you might do     
53:14     
more reactions to become larger you might a new carotic cells you     
53:22     
would uh use your metabolic resources to maintain yourself     
53:27     
or perform service functions so this is the difference between say like     
53:33     
um some other cell type and a eukariotic cell type so this is the difference there     
53:40     
with that evolutionary transition so we can maybe assume that the that tissues     
53:45     
and organs do a similar thing so they going to give some     
53:51     
examples here where you have a paranal cell which is here on its own     
53:56     
there this metabolic self-maintenance on the x-axis function performance on the y- axis this isn't like a study but     
54:03     
they're just showing relationship there's this line that shows death so you have to do a certain     
54:10     
amount of metabolic self-maintenance to stay alive so that's everything to the right of this dotted line and then     
54:16     
functional performance does along this red curve so there's an optimal point which is to keep the cell just alive     
54:25     
enough to alive or you have to do sort of enough just enough metabolism to stay     
54:31     
alive and that's your optimal point you don't want to do too much metabolism because you don't want to go over the     
54:37     
edge of stability but you also want to stay alive so this optimal zone is right here in blue so that's for a single cell     
54:46     
and then for um say if a paral cell comes into some sort of association with     
54:52     
a supporting cell and then you see this in the brain a lot you see this and other tissues and organs where the paral     
55:00     
cell is using the supporting cell as a means for increasing its metabolic     
55:06     
capacity so the parol cell is no longer having to do all the metabolism by itself it's     
55:13     
exchanging energy with the supporting cell exchanging biochemical reactions     
55:18     
with the supporting cell and you have that same relationship with death as the dotted line and then     
55:25     
this new line which is a effect of metabolic complementation so that means that it shifts this blue     
55:32     
function rightward so that the entire function is outside the zone of death     
55:39     
and the functional performance increases so the optimal level of metabolic     
55:44     
self-maintenance is just above keeping that those two cells alive and you end     
55:50     
up with a higher functional performance as a result because this curve is shifted rightly     
55:56     
this is something they call Super functionalization so it's where you have     
56:02     
a single cell that has a certain sort of metabolic     
56:08     
curve in when the cell is in association the metabolic curve shifts so that has a     
56:14     
higher operating capacity     
56:20     
okay and so then they from there they build a hypothesis for the origin of tissues and organs     
56:27     
and they give some more examples here and they get into something called     
56:32     
tradeoffs which is where especially metabolic tradeoffs which is where you have     
56:39     
different types of you know you invest in one thing versus another you invest     
56:44     
in one function versus another and you try to balance those out so in a lot of     
56:51     
there's a whole literature on the evolution of tradeoffs which is where you have have competing Fitness imperatives and you     
56:59     
try to balance them out so this is uh where they say a compelling case of a     
57:04     
metabolic trade-off between adaptive function and cell maintenance pertains     
57:10     
the generation of R metabolically High performing cells require a large amount of energy since     
57:17     
the oxidative processes of ATP production generate a high R load this     
57:23     
increases the cost of Maintenance uh augmentation of focal cellular function     
57:29     
is likely to decrease the inability to invest in a cell's maintenance well the     
57:35     
need for repair increases due to the damaging effects of R um these are free     
57:42     
radicals um in the cell so this is where you're producing a lot of energy you're     
57:49     
producing uh ATP there are these oxidative processes that occur and you     
57:55     
get more free radicals in the cell and the free radicals of course can be damaging in the cell if you have too     
58:00     
many so you want to ma maximize your ability to produce energy to produce ATP     
58:06     
will minimize the effects of R and so you know how do you do that um     
58:13     
so there's that's where we're getting this tradeoff and so then that's an     
58:20     
explanation for having organs and tissues is you can perform that tradeoff     
58:26     
um without too much of a cost so this shows the exine panus and     
58:34     
its Evolution illustrating the proposed transition from Individual cells to tissues and     
58:40     
organs so in example a which is up here this is an early     
58:47     
cordate um and this is aoys um asinar cells which are here     
58:59     
uh are individually dispersed throughout the intestine eventually us and ourselves which are in the intestine of     
59:05     
the aoys here you see these dots it's kind of hard to see but each one of these little dots down here is a     
59:14     
cell eventually asinar cells were integrated into a tissue organ structure     
59:19     
where they are dependent on metabolic complementation from supporting Stell cells so down here we have the ASR cell     
59:27     
which is we see that here as a single cell type in anoys but in say like roin     
59:35     
you have ASR cell which is supported by a stello cell which is     
59:40     
below so that provides this support mechanism and so they're no longer     
59:47     
dispersed throughout the intestine they're integrated into this organ structure where they're dependent on the     
59:53     
metabolic implementation of these stellings so you can see that there's a difference     
59:59     
that you have in one case you have a single cell type it has a certain metabol     
1:00:04     
capacity in in when you get into um vertebrates and especially mammals you     
1:00:12     
get this organ structure where you have this the ASR cell     
1:00:18     
symbiosis and or I don't know if it's a symbiosis it might be some sort of     
1:00:24     
dependency where it increases its metabolic     
1:00:29     
capacity okay so that's pretty good um and so they give some more examples     
1:00:35     
of tissue sustaining metabolic interactions um you know these     
1:00:40     
are just examples from across the tree of life I guess they give one example     
1:00:46     
from the nervous system of uh organisms with a central nervous     
1:00:52     
system wheel cells play supportive roles proving nutritional and homeostatic     
1:00:58     
support for neurons asites of the vertebrate central nervous system are a     
1:01:03     
paradigmatic example of a support C and so they get to they they talk about how     
1:01:09     
if you have a a nervous system actually if you have neurons neurons are very     
1:01:15     
energetically costly and neural activity is also costly so you know it's often said that     
1:01:21     
the brain is like kind of consuming most of the glucose in the body because you     
1:01:26     
know it's expensive to have action potentials it's expensive to be a     
1:01:31     
neural and so you know you you have to think about that when you have bigger brains when you start to expand the     
1:01:37     
nervous system you're expanding not only the ability of the organism to have you     
1:01:43     
know a brain to think with to solve problems with to see the environment     
1:01:48     
with or to uh hear the environment or touch the environment but you're also increasing the metabolic costs of that     
1:01:56     
to the organism so this is where you need to have a nervous system you get enough     
1:02:02     
neurons you need to have a nervous system with asites and with other     
1:02:08     
supporting cells so in this case asites apply lactate for neurons use an     
1:02:14     
oxidation to yield apdp which is involved in energy production dependence     
1:02:19     
of neurons of aerobic metabolism is Manifest in cultured uh neurons     
1:02:26     
that die very quickly without oxygen so U neurons are dependent on aerobic     
1:02:33     
metabolism and you can observe this um in culture asites store glycogen to     
1:02:39     
overcome periods of glucose so asites are specialized to sort of provide a     
1:02:46     
means for aerobic metabolism for the neurons so that's what their optim support cells um uptake glutamate from     
1:02:55     
synaptic bace to eliminat transmitter activity and synthesize glutamate by     
1:03:00     
Alpha ketoglutarate in the citric acid cycle to extrude in the intracellular     
1:03:07     
space source of neuronal glutamine so when you couple asites with neurons and     
1:03:15     
especially neural activity asites release precursors uh a     
1:03:20     
glutathion a major antioxidant effector strengthening the protection against     
1:03:26     
R together with endothelial cells providing oxygen and glucose neurons and     
1:03:32     
Gia form a metabolic hum so neurons Bon end of the oal cells all form this     
1:03:37     
metabolic unit instead of just having neurons trying to produce all their match all of their own     
1:03:44     
energy so that's a good example and they go a little bit into more detail about that as what was banal cells in the     
1:03:52     
pancreas and um so that's and then that's pretty much the rest the the end of the paper they have some nice     
1:03:58     
references in here and I think it's a I think it's a decent hypothesis um it's     
1:04:05     
something you know we don't talk about when we talk about tissues as much about energy production and about metabolism     
1:04:13     
and especially those evolutionary trade-offs that need to be there because it's worth mentioning that I mean you     
1:04:20     
know when we talk about complex systems in biology we're talking about different     
1:04:25     
Fitness imperatives we're talking about balancing those Fitness imperatives especially as we have this     
1:04:32     
functional unit which is the tissue organ and you know how do we get from     
1:04:39     
say like very simple morphologies very simple systems to more complex     
1:04:45     
systems so any comments or     
1:04:53     
questions I think that's interesting um I I want to look into it a bit bit     
1:05:00     
more closely I'm still putting lunches together here but um uh     
1:05:06     
um yeah May me also think just a little bit about the     
1:05:14     
difficulty identifying cell types in some some structures and you know like     
1:05:23     
like you said you know it's um yeah I I that makes sense if you     
1:05:32     
understand you know how celles do change that that there yeah yeah like how much     
1:05:38     
pressure there is really or certainly that you'd expect to Spectrum and um     
1:05:47     
uh just just wanted to say I mean thinking a little bit about the kind of     
1:05:53     
um energetics and and other things I I went down a little rabbit hole of     
1:05:59     
biological condensates last night just just talking about yeah and     
1:06:07     
and you know that certainly just acknowledging that we     
1:06:15     
still there's still a lot of kind of the forces and and     
1:06:22     
complexities within a cell that are still very not well     
1:06:28     
understood um and and you know the fact that we're still say     
1:06:35     
discovering um these kinds of you know phenomena     
1:06:42     
that that at first are discoveries and then our second are found to be absolutely you know     
1:06:50     
ubiquitous like it's like it's like it's it's it's wanted to Discovery like oh     
1:06:55     
this is this is very novel and then it's like oh it's actually everywhere we look for it now you know um uh and that yeah     
1:07:06     
just just just that that you know some of these pressures and things might be     
1:07:12     
better understood if we understood how even a single cell manages the complexity that     
1:07:20     
it manages and and again like condensates just being one of those examples     
1:07:26     
um um yeah anyway had a little thought about just     
1:07:32     
you know excitatory inhibitory balances from     
1:07:37     
the last paper but um but I would uh I can't remember for that far back yeah so I'm catching up on last     
1:07:46     
week's video but um as well but um anyway uh uh great papers as as always     
1:07:53     
thank you yeah yes so yeah it's worth thinking about these papers together in terms especially in terms of EI balance     
1:08:00     
and some of those networks and then thinking about building complexity and how that happens and uh we haven't     
1:08:07     
talked about a lot about evolutionary trade-offs but it is a fascinating concept because we can tend to think of     
1:08:15     
like sometimes we tend to think about Evolution as like you know we think about single Fitness imperatives like we     
1:08:20     
say okay well obviously there was this trait that was favored and you know in     
1:08:27     
we think about this in terms of like the entire organism or in terms of Fitness Landscapes often times we have competing     
1:08:35     
imperatives pulling at the organism so at the organism level at the organismal     
1:08:41     
level we have multiple Fitness imperatives at the same time you're in in one environment and I know there     
1:08:49     
might be one function that is well highly favored but there are other functions that you know are maybe also     
1:08:55     
so favored or disfavored and so those all kind of tug the organ the organismal     
1:09:01     
population different directions and you also have you know different types of processes like where     
1:09:08     
you need to produce a lot of energy but you also need to get rid of waste or you don't want to you know you want to     
1:09:14     
produce a lot of energy because you simply you can't have a bigger brain if you help produce more energy so you know     
1:09:22     
how do you how do you solve those problems and it's not now I don't want to say that cells are actively solving     
1:09:28     
problems but there are like ways that you know things that get favored over other things and that's kind of how we     
1:09:36     
get to this next level of organization where we get specialized tissues from     
1:09:41     
things that are less specialized so that's kind of the lesson there but     
1:09:47     
anyways I welcome people to think about these topics and you know if you're interested in coming up with a     
1:09:54     
hypothesis or project of of some type or some other thing you're welcome to     
1:09:59     
present in meetings and or even if it's just kind of you know kind of     
1:10:05     
unorganized thoughts that's also welcome we usion we have chew on those for a while as     
1:10:11     
well so thank you for attending today's meeting anything else before we go     
1:10:25     
okay if not uh thank you for attending see you next week thank you take care thank you     
1:10:33     
bye bye bye
