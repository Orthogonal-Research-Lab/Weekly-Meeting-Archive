hello hello how are you how you all     
0:08     
right okay     
0:15     
yeah     
0:20     
yeah do G     
0:28     
okay so yeah do you have any updates for us     
0:45     
or I have a little again but I guess we talking     
0:51     
about the dates for my life yeah yeah uh uh were uh I was working singles     
1:04     
so this uh I'm to focus on     
1:10     
uh what we going on and I I have a time     
1:16     
from today on yeah uh trying to at least have 20 which on paper from     
1:28     
this I guess okay you're going through the papers     
1:34     
and you're going through the papers and looking over reading     
1:39     
them uh yeah uh both and also the that     
1:45     
last week about to some fromal     
1:51     
andri view the actually point that what we uh beginning of the     
2:01     
for developmental procedure so I'm trying to uh see is Poss     
2:09     
current data model uh behavior and and     
2:15     
that beginning uh of course it would I find     
2:24     
some some I     
2:30     
could I'm to try to some uh thought just like uh to see     
2:42     
for example how long or how actually say     
2:48     
how long an Impulse could go up the level     
2:53     
that uh it's some uh uh     
3:02     
somehow for for those con muscles     
3:07     
something like that uh this is some I would like to work on also there are     
3:13     
some other some other maybe uh topics     
3:19     
that uh somehow po the line like uh the     
3:26     
amount energy needed for or DNA     
3:32     
B that comes from     
3:40     
only is for for the and how it be actually     
3:48     
possible to relate relate any levels into     
3:55     
uh the model that would be possible to maybe War for the     
4:04     
first     
4:09     
yeah yeah that's good yeah so I would you know I would just kind of write down     
4:14     
those topics and kind of refine them as you go along and you know so it's good that's a     
4:24     
sh reive the of yeah yeah I did get I did     
4:31     
get that email so I've been looking at that document and so yeah I haven't looked at it in a couple days     
4:39     
but okay yeah all right it's great uh how are you     
4:46     
Moran I know if you're just listening in or     
4:55     
what all right so I guess uh dick won't be joining us today and and I don't know about Susan I don't think she'll be     
5:01     
joining us either but um it's okay     
5:06     
um yeah so that sounds great Ved uh keep me keep us posted on that uh and we     
5:13     
we'll keep working on that yeah all right so the chat yeah Jesse said he'll     
5:18     
be listening in that's good welcome Jesse uh so let me share my screen we     
5:25     
have some things we can talk about um     
5:34     
so one of the things that we've been uh kind of getting into     
5:40     
is uh talking about morphogenesis in different ways and this is a series of     
5:46     
papers on morphogenesis and Tangles and sheets some of them are kind of physics     
5:51     
oriented biophysics oriented papers but they kind of go through some of these uh     
5:57     
Cutting Edge topics so let's start with this one uh this is this paper is uh     
6:03     
from PRX life so this is a new Journal that um uh physics reviews uh journals     
6:10     
put out this is uh physics reviews X or PRX and this is from their first issue     
6:17     
or their first volume I guess and uh the title of this is tension remodeling     
6:23     
regulates topological Transitions and epithelial tissues it has a kind of a     
6:30     
uh alliteration quality but uh basically it's it's talking about tension     
6:36     
Remodeling and how that plays a role in regulation of tissues     
6:41     
um so I think we talked about this in another earlier meeting where you know     
6:46     
we talked about the ways in which we can regulate cells in a sheet or in some     
6:53     
other uh way and of course in this case it's tension remodeling so um it's     
6:59     
following up on that line of of inquiry so uh the abstract reads sell     
7:06     
neighbor exchanges play a critical role in regulating tissue fluidity during     
7:11     
epithelial morphogenesis so this is where you know cells are kind of in next to one another     
7:17     
in a sheet and their neighbors exchange uh things sometimes information     
7:25     
sometimes physical signals sometimes chemical signals and so these neighbor     
7:30     
exchanges play a critical role in regulating tissue fluidity and when they     
7:35     
say tissue fluidity they mean like the sort of the nature of the tissue the behavior of the tissue coordinated     
7:42     
migrations and things like that uh and so we've talked about epithelia morphogenesis actually Susan     
7:49     
has been on this topic quite a bit um you know with epithelial cells they form     
7:55     
a sheet and then they you know do certain there there are certain movements that get made in epithelial     
8:02     
sheets that are very interesting to from a biophysics     
8:08     
perspective uh so inv Vivo which means that they're doing these things within the context of a tissue and an     
8:15     
organism these neighbor exchanges are often hindered by the formation of transiently stable four-fold vertices so     
8:23     
this is uh something that Susan brought up at the end of last year and she was     
8:29     
talking about this literature on Tri Junctions so uh if you haven't caught up     
8:36     
on that so what happens in a lot of these epithelial sheets is you get uh     
8:42     
different Junctions between the cells so if we have say like a sheet of     
8:47     
cells I'll just draw a sheet of cells     
8:54     
here you'll see that there are these Junction points and the junction points     
9:01     
will have sort of a fold aspect to them so in this sheet we have a     
9:08     
three-fold junction or a tri     
9:14     
Junction and this is maybe where you have one you know three cells that meet     
9:19     
together and there's a corner that defines that Union or you could have a a     
9:25     
quad Junction where you know uh four cells come     
9:32     
together and they meet at this uh vertex we can call it a Vertex if we think     
9:37     
about this as a network or if we think about this as sort of an interacting system and so these different junctions     
9:45     
have there's some people think that there's some sort of role in maintaining the stability of the tissue maintaining     
9:53     
sort of the Dynamics of the tissue and maintaining the interactions between the neighbors and so these Tri Junctions     
9:59     
there's a an emerging literature on this and Susan would be better to speak to     
10:06     
about this but basically this is a literature that started in about 2018 and is is kind of a Hot Topic right     
10:14     
now so they're talking about in this paper these quad Junctions or these four-way Junctions and so that's what     
10:21     
we'll be talking about here um and so uh neighbor exchanges are     
10:28     
often rered in this case by the formation of transiently stable four-fold vertices so these four-fold     
10:35     
vertices aren't like you know they don't exist for very long is the cells are     
10:40     
moving around in the tissue you get these four-fold vertices that uh but     
10:46     
they can also hinder sort of this migration because you get you know you get stickiness you get this sort of uh     
10:54     
these constraints on the cells and so that's what they're getting at there uh um uh so you have these transiently     
11:02     
stable four-fold vertices which can develop into complex multicellular rosettes where five or more Jun cell     
11:09     
Junctions meet so these are structures that have five or more cell     
11:15     
Junctions um and so despite their importance mechanical origin of     
11:20     
multicellular rosettes where you have these uh cell Jun this this uh density     
11:27     
of cell junctions have Elusive and current cellular models lack the ability     
11:32     
to explain their formation and maintenance here we present a dynamic vertex model of epithelial tissues with     
11:40     
strain dependent tension Remodeling and mechanical memory dissipation we show     
11:45     
that an increase in cell Junction tension upon contraction and reduction in tension upon extension so we're     
11:53     
talking about these cell Junctions uh we talk about tension upon contraction so as the cells contract     
12:01     
they provide tension and then there's this reduction in tension upon extension     
12:07     
and this can stabilize higher order vertices temporarily stalling cell arrangements so this can be like the     
12:14     
sort of jamming phase transition that we we've talked about in in uh tissue formation and in soft     
12:22     
materials where if you get a certain density of particles or of cells it can     
12:28     
you know there can be a flow of them say through a pipe or through some sort of throughput uh space and then as they get     
12:37     
dense more densely packed or packed in a certain way they can slow down and stop     
12:42     
so that's a jamming phase transition you go from motility to this sort of     
12:49     
stoppage this sort of quiessence and so that's they're kind of getting at here     
12:54     
they're trying to identify some of these phase transitions some of these mechanisms behind the formation of these     
13:01     
high order vertices on the one hand inducing mechanical memory dissipation by     
13:08     
relaxation of Junction strain and stress so there's this these strains and stresses at each of these     
13:14     
Junctions uh particular at the tri Junctions but also at these quad Junctions and then the rosettes at their     
13:20     
higher order number of Junction uh number of Junctions as     
13:26     
well uh facilitating cell neighbor changes we demonstrate that by tuning the rates ATT tension Remodeling and     
13:33     
mechanical memory dissipation we can control topological Transitions and     
13:39     
tissue material properties recapitulating complex cellular topologies seen in developing     
13:46     
organisms so they talk about fluidization of epithelial tissues which     
13:51     
is important in a lot of things in early development cell migration wound healing     
13:56     
Etc so the ability for epithelial cells to move freely and change their     
14:01     
configuration is important in a lot of development and regeneration and so this is the kind of     
14:09     
thing that you know they're trying to understand what happens when these things get you know uh when these things     
14:16     
stop happening or start happening or you know when they're facilitated or constrained in some way so that's what     
14:23     
they're getting at here uh during a neighbor exchange process occurring via T1     
14:29     
transition two cells in contact shrink their Shar Junction to a single point forming a fourfold ver ver fourfold     
14:37     
vertex so this is where the cell will you know change its shape they're not     
14:42     
necessarily just these squares like these two cells will join     
14:48     
like they'll have this uh space here and then as they start to sort of shrink     
14:55     
back they'll come into contact with other cells forming a junction so you have to think     
15:02     
about this in terms of the cell changing its shape and its size uh over time so     
15:08     
this happens um you know     
15:13     
dynamically um this four-fold vertex then extends in a new intercellular     
15:18     
Junction in a direction orthogonal to the Contracting Junction while neighbor exchange processes rely on the     
15:25     
instability of four-fold vertices and Vivo EXP expent showed the four four-fold vertices can be stable for     
15:32     
long times in developing tissues so during a wa aisy long and     
15:38     
oropa uh and these can persist up to 15 to 40 minutes uh and we can also see this in     
15:45     
other systems as well um so let me see if we have any figures this will make us a little bit     
15:51     
easier uh they have uh they have some mathematical modeling that they do here     
15:56     
this is their vertex model with tension REM modeling so they model the vertices     
16:02     
and then they also have the tension remodeling as a result so this is where the cells are remodeled and their     
16:09     
Junctions are     
16:15     
remodeled so they show kind of the physical model of this they use a dashpot and spring model to model these     
16:22     
interactions between the cells and the formation of these Junctions and they have a phase uh d diagram here where     
16:30     
they show the stable and unstable modes of     
16:35     
this um so this is a picture actually uh we     
16:41     
kind of Revisited this kind of a diagram in from Susan's work I think in December     
16:47     
she talked about this where you have these diagrams where you show these Junctions in an array of cells so     
16:56     
um so here we are uh a this diagram up here representative section of a     
17:02     
simulated epithelial tissue with tension remodeling so you have these cells and     
17:07     
they have these irregular shapes it's almost like a a tiling of some type and     
17:12     
you have these red dots which are the Junctions between the cells and as you     
17:18     
can imagine as the cells change their shape and their size and they contract     
17:23     
and expand against one another these Junctions change so you see here you have     
17:30     
uh I think this is a seven or eight fold Junction here where I'm pointing my     
17:35     
mouse uh I think it is an Eightfold Junction where you have eight cells coming together at one point and so     
17:42     
they're all kind of centered around that point uh this is uh I think a sixfold     
17:48     
junction uh there's a think this is a four or fivefold Junction and this is a fourfold junction     
17:56     
and so forth so Susan was really onto this trifold Junction literature and     
18:03     
this uh this paper suggests that there's many more types of fold Junctions that     
18:09     
we can understand in in their role and development um this B here this this     
18:16     
figure B is normalized Junction length and tension as a function of time relative to the fourfold vertex creation     
18:24     
or instantaneous and delayed T1 events so this is for t one this is uh     
18:30     
normalized Junction length this is uh time relative to four-fold vertex     
18:36     
creation so you can see that there's this uh you have     
18:42     
larger I guess the junction length is larger uh for shorter and longer times     
18:49     
and then there's this decrease in the middle uh of of this time relative to     
18:55     
full fourfold Forex Creation in minutes so you get this sort of pattern where     
19:00     
you know we have cells that contract against one another form a junction and then they expand maybe against one     
19:07     
another and the junction goes away so just showing these Dynamics     
19:14     
um and so in this figure three tension remodeling promotes asymmetric length     
19:20     
distribution uh this is a histogram of Junctions at steady uh Junction length at steady state so this is remodeling is     
19:28     
no remodeling we see the fraction of total Junctions on the y- AIS and the     
19:34     
normalized junction length here so this is a normalized junction length is a     
19:39     
function of fraction of total Junctions so in other words with no remodeling you     
19:45     
get these normalized Junction lengths of one which are most common and that's a     
19:50     
unimodal distribution from zero to about 1.75 or so with remodeling you get a a     
19:57     
wider variety of different Junction lengths and as we might expect there's this each of those are a smaller     
20:04     
fraction of total Junctions so you have this broad spectrum from like zero to     
20:12     
almost three in terms of normalized Junction length so this is just basically saying that remodeling induces     
20:19     
a lot more variety in the uh Junction length so this is uh just means that     
20:25     
cells are moving around a lot more and they're more dynamic and they're making these different types of connections and they're moving     
20:32     
against one another whereas with no remodeling you get these sort of jamming states where they're kind of stuck in a     
20:40     
mode you know and and so that's that's basically showing that um then this is     
20:45     
actually where we have uh in B correlation between total Junction     
20:51     
tension uh and Junction length and tissues with blue and without black     
20:58     
Junction remodeling so this is uh without Junction Remodeling and with Junction remodeling so blue has with     
21:05     
Junction remodeling you get a wider variety of Junction     
21:10     
lengths uh normalized Junction tension increases as the junction length     
21:16     
decreases uh the same isn't necessarily true where you have without Junction     
21:22     
remodeling so where when the Junctions don't remodel you get sort of this uh     
21:27     
narrow range of Junction lengths and the junction tension is more or less     
21:33     
constant uh so yeah and then that's that's basically it's basically support     
21:38     
for a that there are these uh Dynamic things     
21:43     
going on in the in the     
21:49     
tissue and so this is interesting here this figure this is a frequency versus     
21:54     
the number of sides so this this fig figure talks about tension modeling influencing the     
22:01     
geometry of cell packing uh this is where we have solids versus fluids or a solid regime and a     
22:08     
fluid regime and we can see that there are these different shapes that form so this     
22:14     
figure here C this was like something that um Susan was interested in in terms of     
22:20     
Tri Junctions these are where you get these triangles these octagons and these     
22:26     
nonagons and they're just different shapes that form based on the Junctions and the cells around them and so you see     
22:34     
that in a solid these shapes are basically all sort of a frequency of     
22:39     
almost zero in a fluid they jump up or at least the octagons jump up greatly uh     
22:46     
triangles increase with the K KL uh proportion     
22:52     
here as that increases and the nonagons don't really increase that much but they do a little bit so there is a uh greater     
23:00     
diversity of sort of different types of Junctions in fluids uh octagons become more common in     
23:08     
fluids uh in this case we have a solid fluid transition these are squares and     
23:14     
red pentagons and blue he heptagons and and purple and and uh hexagons and     
23:23     
green we can see that hexagons are dominant in si ID s but that once you     
23:29     
get to a fluid the number of hexagons Falls and the number of pentagons     
23:35     
increases and the number of squares increases as well heptagons are always kind of rare but they're you know kind     
23:42     
of a constant between solids and fluids so you can get from these figures that     
23:47     
there are differences between solids and fluids in terms of these Junctions and the shapes they form and and it's just     
23:54     
evidence again that you know when cells move around in different different media     
23:59     
in different contexts that they have these different properties um so this is uh where we     
24:06     
look at the geometry of cell packing so we see that the number this is a     
24:14     
u this is a graph showing the number of sides versus the frequency so you see     
24:19     
these different K KL values and you end up with these different shapes so we have uh     
24:28     
um this shape here which is dominant and we have other shapes so we have a     
24:35     
pentagon a hexagon and so forth and so we can see that there's a hexagon     
24:41     
hexagonal Arrangement is the most common and the Triangular is the least common     
24:47     
and so I guess this is the nonagon down here and so we can see this unimodal     
24:52     
distribution centered on the hexagons so that's enough about that     
24:58     
paper I thought that was interesting in light of some of the things we've talked about with respect to that this is an     
25:06     
interesting paper from uh the archive I'm not sure what Journal this is     
25:11     
published in it might not be published yet uh but this is uh from a group that     
25:18     
includes uh Albert Lazlo barbass who's of course a big networks person and this     
25:24     
is a paper on bundling by volume exclusion a non-equilibrium     
25:29     
spaghetti so this is not directly uh doing biological experiments     
25:36     
or you know biophysics but it talks about physical networks and the examples     
25:41     
I give here in the abstract are like the brain or meta materials so the abstract     
25:47     
of this paper reads in physical networks like the brain or meta materials we     
25:53     
often observe local bundles corresponding to locally aligned link     
25:58     
configurations here we introduce a minimal model for bundle formation uh you'll see this down here     
26:05     
below modeling physical networks as non-equilibrium packings of Hardcore 3D     
26:11     
elongated links and so this is where we have these again these these packings     
26:16     
that shift and move around and so they model these as hardcore 3D elongated     
26:22     
links so they're elastic but they have this 3D property we show that growth is     
26:28     
logarithmic and time in stark contrast with the algebraic behavior of lower     
26:33     
dimensional random packing models equally important we find that the slow kinetics is metastable allowing us to     
26:40     
analytically predict an algebraic growth due to spontaneous formation of bundles     
26:46     
and so this offers a mechanism for bundle formation resulting purely from volume exclusion and provide a benchmark     
26:54     
for bundling activation and growth so they're they're interest interested in the Assembly of physical networks that     
27:00     
have these kind of properties so these include neural tracts which are bundles     
27:06     
of nerve fibers uh biopolymers U and so these are different     
27:12     
types of graphs so when we think about graphs you know we think about the standard type of network that we're you     
27:19     
know usually use for modeling you know Gene Gene interactions or protein     
27:24     
protein interactions this is a little bit different from that stand graph and so uh the one of the reasons for this is     
27:32     
because we have we're kind of modeling the physics of something so we're modeling three-dimensional objects     
27:38     
instead of like abstracting you know information about interactions between     
27:45     
uh things that aren't really geometric in nature so they have this sort of spatial property they have this     
27:51     
geometric property and this is one of the things we've been working on with embryo networks that you know there     
27:57     
these you could extract these networks that describe interactions but you also have this physical aspect where you have     
28:05     
the 3D uh morphology that you have to characterize and then there's interactions between the 3D morphology     
28:12     
and the interactions and that map so this is an interesting and I think Susan     
28:19     
uh did another paper she presented on another paper where they had something like this where they were doing it's     
28:26     
like they did a set of experiments where they had like these rods and these packings and I can't remember the exact     
28:33     
paper but this is this interesting in light of that paper that     
28:39     
discussion so um well the impact of volume exclusion has been widely     
28:44     
explored in the realm of equilibrium Gran granular and colloid materials made of short rodlike particles so this is an     
28:51     
example of a rod and these rods you see them all the time in biology you see uh     
28:57     
different types of uh bacteria have Rod like shaped uh morphologies you have     
29:03     
other types of like nerve bundles or nerve fibers that have this kind of morphology so it's common in biology to     
29:10     
see this um little is known but its influence during the non-equilibrium     
29:15     
assembly of elongated filaments like those characterizing the architecture of physical networks and so it's it's     
29:23     
unknown whether volume exclusion alone can give rise to link B in a system for     
29:28     
from equilibrium as existing models either assume Crosslink interactions or     
29:33     
operate at equilibrium conditions so this is their model of uh sort of one of     
29:39     
these bundle networks these are bar bipartite 3D links so we have uh     
29:45     
three-dimensional links and we have this bipartite uh Network um and so uh a this Rod here or     
29:56     
this Rod shape this actually shows a deposited link so you have uh this node     
30:04     
and then you have this Halo excluded volume so this is like a volume that go     
30:09     
follows this link downward from this surface down towards so we have Z equals uh Z equals z and Z     
30:18     
equals 1 the note is at Z equals one and there's this Halo excluded volume that     
30:24     
moves down to Z equal Z so you have this initial position at Z equal 0 XY and you     
30:30     
have this excluded volume that comes from the next time point or I guess the next position and the Z uh     
30:37     
Dimension that is kind of linked to that it's going around there's a radius of     
30:43     
that so in other words if you have a rod you can measure it from sort of its base and it has this uh sort of uh     
30:51     
angular gyration radius and then you can measure the excluded volume from the     
30:57     
base to the uh the object that's going around this uh volume so this whole     
31:03     
volume can be excluded and so you end up with a model like this where you get a     
31:08     
you know these rods or these excluded volumes that cut across to one another they form this     
31:15     
dense uh uh volume here and so this is the way they build     
31:20     
their Network so basically they're taking the idea of nodes they're building in a     
31:27     
volume volumetric aspect to it and then they're you know using that as part of     
31:32     
their network uh so keeping only the essential     
31:40     
properties of these systems we introduce a bipart type model consisting of physical links modeled to slanted     
31:47     
cylinders of diameter whose end points are constrained to the opposite faces of     
31:52     
a unitary Cube so the end points are constrained to the faces of the cube and then they go     
32:00     
within the cube we deposit the links by random sequential deposition uh and just the method that     
32:07     
they use we show that this physical link model can be solved analytically enabling an exact comparison against     
32:14     
simulations we find that at the temporal onset of physicality the packing     
32:19     
kinetics undergo a dynamical transition from a non-interacting regime to a     
32:25     
strongly interacting one the density of links evolves logarithmically in time in     
32:30     
start Cent interest that the algebraic growth observed in one and two needo likee systems this is in citations 41     
32:38     
and 43 so 41 and 43 uh are down here so we have uh this     
32:48     
paper from 1991 ASM totic results for the random sequential addition of unoriented     
32:56     
objects and this paper 43 from car parking to protein     
33:01     
absorption an overview of sequential absorption processes this is from 2000     
33:06     
so this is kind of following up on a problem that's been around for a while um in soft     
33:20     
materials so these are the kinetic stabilities so you see that they have their their volume here this is their     
33:27     
Network and they try this for they do nearly saturated packing of links and     
33:33     
for different parameter values and you see that there's a difference here so they test this for different parameter     
33:43     
values and then they show bundling formation and bundling onset so they     
33:48     
actually can show these things happening in the network as a consequence of the way the network is     
33:55     
structured you see a lot of local bundling which is this picture down here     
34:01     
and you know a lot of things you can get out of this kind of     
34:06     
model okay so that's that paper uh the next one here is inflation collapse     
34:12     
Dynamics uh which is of course something that we see this is maybe more biological uh this I think is done in     
34:19     
organoid cultures so this is something that Morgan might be interested in uh in     
34:25     
terms of like how some of these uh morphologies happen to form so they use     
34:33     
this uh inflation collapse Dynamics model and so let's get into it uh let's     
34:38     
look at the graphical abstract first uh this is uh where they have     
34:44     
these Triple Decker sandwich cultures where they can do you know they can facilitate uniform     
34:50     
growth the organoids that they grow have these stem cell zones uh characterized     
34:57     
by expression of lgr5 so these are lgr5 positive stem cell     
35:02     
zones then you get this inflation collapse driven fision mediated by P1     
35:08     
which is a a pro uh a pressure sensing protein so you get this uh mediated     
35:15     
inflation where you get the zone that inflates in size and then you get uh     
35:20     
increased pressure in this Zone and this is where Paso one is mediating lgr5 loss     
35:26     
so as The Zone increases in size the stem cell Zone it starts you know the     
35:32     
pressure of that zone starts to shut down the expression of lgr5 so it's just     
35:37     
like if you're blowing up a balloon and you get a higher pressure of air inside the balloon you know if something were     
35:44     
in the balloon that's pressure sensitive it would be affected and so this is kind of what is going on here and then you     
35:52     
have this inflation collapse driven fision mediated by Paso one where there's budding during the collapse so     
35:59     
this this stem cell Zone it the cells shut down of their expression of     
36:05     
lgr5 and then that that large Zone collapses into these buds so you see     
36:11     
these buds which are now all lgr5 positive that start to happen during the     
36:17     
collapse and then you have this Bas one Clute positive stretch state where you     
36:23     
get the stretching of the organoid and these uh these buds that kind of come off the     
36:29     
edge um and so they change shape and you see these areas here and red and then     
36:37     
inhibit cftp a one so if you inhibit those proteins you get fewer fision     
36:43     
events so you don't get as many fision events if you inhibit certain genes and proteins within this system so this is     
36:51     
just kind of looking at how organoids grow and change shape and how they get     
36:56     
get these these stem cell zones where they they can then do further     
37:02     
differentiation so in brief intestinal organoids contain stem cell zones that     
37:07     
resemble the Crypt base and Vivo so they're stem cell Crypts in in organisms     
37:13     
you know where you have stem cells sources of stem cells that come out and     
37:19     
you know we have them in the brain we have them in other areas of the uh of the body where they replenish cells it's     
37:26     
it provides an engine for regeneration and so in this case this is what organoids are doing uh we studied     
37:33     
scz patterning by live Imaging and perturbing organoids and sandwich cultures which are these things up here     
37:40     
we found that sczs undergo paod dependent Vision driven by inflation and collapse of the organoid Lumen so this     
37:48     
is the Lumen here and inflation induces a stretch Associated cell state so when     
37:54     
you inflate it there's a stretch do cell state which are the shut which is the shutdown of this lgr5 marker and so you     
38:04     
can actually change cell state with pressure basically is what they're saying and the pressure of inflation of     
38:11     
of the surrounding     
38:16     
tissue so this this kind of goes through some of this uh some of the Dynamics of     
38:21     
vision and some of these uh biophysical uh States that we observe in these     
38:29     
systems and so the you know one of the important things about organoids and actually about tissue formation in     
38:37     
development and in cellular reprogramming is you need niches uh     
38:42     
which are these spaces in the organ or in the tissue or in the culture that     
38:49     
allow for the differentiation of certain cells sometimes to maintain stemness but     
38:54     
we get these niches in this so that's that's what they're trying to     
39:00     
recapitulate so um let's see     
39:07     
um the intestinal epithelium is a stereotypical self-renewing tissue so     
39:13     
they're trying to model the intestinal epithelium uh this is a model that     
39:18     
allows us to study self organization and Niche control in most mammals the intestinal epithelium under goes a neur     
39:25     
complete turnover every three to five days uh supporting this turnover     
39:30     
equipotent lg5 positive intestinal stem cells so these are isc's and you know     
39:37     
this this is where we're getting our source of intestinal cells um in intestinal um epithelial     
39:45     
cells with clust which cluster and stem cell zones at the basis of a evaginated     
39:51     
Crypts uh and so then isc's differentiate into several cell types     
39:56     
then emerge from Crypts in VII and form the luminal surface of the intestine in     
40:02     
homeostasis which is what were you know in a in a tissue you would see the sort     
40:07     
of homeostatic mechanism cell division at the Crypt base precisely balance a cell loss at the villis tip so this is     
40:16     
these uh Crypts that they show uh model the villis tip so they're modeling     
40:21     
different aspects of the invivo tissue um ex the an extrinsic niche formed by     
40:26     
the underlying non-epithelial mezanine supports these behaviors as cells     
40:32     
migrate up the cryp philis Axis they lose mitogenic stimulation and become     
40:37     
exposed to signals that promote differentiation so basically this aspect     
40:43     
of the     
40:48     
um if we go up to this uh figure again we see these uh these structures here     
40:56     
and they're modeling the VII basically and so this is this is what they're trying to sort of recapitulate they're     
41:02     
sort of doing it it's not perfect but that's what they're trying to do and the argument that they're making     
41:08     
is that if you're in a real tissue there is this aspect of the there's a there's     
41:13     
a a micro environment or a niche that enables a lot of this to happen and so     
41:19     
they're able to sort of recapitulate this Niche by through this you know     
41:25     
these sorts of um these sorts of uh Crypts or these these pressure um things     
41:34     
so this is this is something that is a I think it's an interesting paper from the     
41:39     
standpoint of you know how realistic are organoid models with respect to actual     
41:46     
tissues what can they tell us about a lot of the processes going on in those     
41:53     
tissues so the final paper in this group is uh creative processes during     
42:00     
ver vertebrate organm morphogenesis biophysical self organization at the super cellular scale     
42:07     
and this is from a group including Amy Shire and Alan Rodriguez and we've talked about some of     
42:13     
their work in in meetings last year we were talking about some of their work um on epithelial cells in     
42:20     
fact and you know they're interested in self-organization and morphogenesis so this is an interesting     
42:28     
paper that kind of draws you know draws out that idea further uh so this is what they talk     
42:35     
about is creative processes during morphogenesis so what they mean by creative processes what see what they     
42:43     
mean so here we review recent developments in the literature that provide insight into self-organization     
42:50     
at supracellular Scales inverte to work in morphogenesis so we sort of saw you     
42:55     
know examples of tissues certain specific tissue types and models of those epithelial tissue types in     
43:02     
particular with they're looking at as supracellular scales which could be you know organs or could be tissues mostly     
43:09     
organ in this case we briefly present a historical and conceptual analysis of     
43:16     
the term self-organization based on this analysis we suggest this that self-organizing     
43:23     
processes at their root as a form of causal relationship reciprocal causality     
43:30     
and this is I know that Jesse and Morgan and and I were at our meeting on     
43:36     
Saturday we were talking about cybernetics and some of the things you know that they they think about     
43:42     
reciprocal causality a lot so it's kind of an interesting point that this comes up     
43:48     
here uh so this reciprocal causality is markedly distinct from linear linear     
43:55     
causal chains we survey the extent to which reciprocal causality can be used to interpret or     
44:02     
clarify supracellular studies and development and disease finally we explore how reciprocal causality can     
44:09     
exist across length scales identifying situations or multiple scales require     
44:14     
simultaneous analysis this is an interesting paper on     
44:20     
sort of some of these ideas of feedback and these and and tissue more Genesis     
44:26     
and even organ morphogenesis so this is their model system that they use     
44:33     
experimentally uh they they do this stuff with feather follicle formation so     
44:38     
they're interested in sort of the patterns that form in feathers and birds     
44:44     
um and I think in chicks is what they're doing uh so this this shows an example     
44:50     
of how this process works so you have this uh day6 embryo with an anterior     
44:57     
posterior orientation and over two days to day eight you have these patter this pattern     
45:05     
of feather follicles so there are these little buds on the surface of the embryo     
45:10     
here oriented in this line from anterior to posterior but you notice that there     
45:16     
this there's this pattern where they're sort of distributed in the certain way     
45:21     
and so this is because these processes are sort of spatially restricted you     
45:27     
have these uh cells here so you know before bical initiation skin is a     
45:33     
uniform bilayer consisting of epithelial and mesenchimal cell layers so up here     
45:39     
you see the epithelial cell layer at the top are these Square cells arranged in a     
45:45     
a single layer and then uh this mesenchimal layer which is an orange     
45:52     
so you get uh and so then you get this uh sort of this aggregation of these     
46:00     
cells here they push up these mezanine cells they push up on the epithelial     
46:05     
layer and they form these buds which you see here this is from day six to day8 so     
46:13     
you have this disorganized set of cells on the bottom layer they kind of bunch     
46:18     
up they start to push up on the epithelial Cellar uh cells on the top     
46:23     
layer and that deformation leads to these buds which will eventually end up forming these feathers that will come     
46:29     
out it's kind of like a hair follicles and so you get these basically     
46:37     
what you have to do is you have to get these Aggregates so these cells have to aggregate in some way and the Aggregates     
46:43     
have to be patterned they can't just be you know in random positions I guess they could be in I guess you could say     
46:49     
they're quaz random but uh they have to be in a way that covers the organism the     
46:55     
feathers have to be organized and as we see with hair with feathers there's this     
47:00     
organ spatial organization that's important so they show this this model     
47:06     
here in C of substrate resistance versus Cell traction so these cells have to     
47:13     
have some type of resistance against the substrate so they have to be you know     
47:18     
pulled back by uh the resistance of the substrate but they also have to have     
47:23     
traction to push them forward so you see there's this res reduction resistance     
47:29     
and this increase in traction over time or over these different conditions which     
47:36     
is that in the no agregate condition you have a lot of substrate resistance it's     
47:41     
almost dominating the system when you have many Aggregates you have a mix of     
47:46     
substrate resistance and cell traction and then for when cell traction dominates you get one aggregate which is     
47:53     
also not desirable because then you would end up with a single large Bud     
47:59     
here in this uh layer and you'd only get like one very large follicle for a     
48:06     
feather so that wouldn't be good either so it's a balance between these two to get these many     
48:12     
Aggregates and so that's the problem they're trying to solve uh they point out that there is no molecular blueprint     
48:19     
instructing each cell to decide to join an aggregate inversely the spontaneous     
48:24     
formation of super cellular Aggregates and forms expression levels of VAR signaling     
48:30     
molecules uh and and so in other words new information and structure are created by     
48:36     
self-organization at the supracellular scale self organization matters for ferate organ morphogenesis because it     
48:43     
provides a means for growing tissues and organs to increase their complexity and create new ordered forms it is a     
48:50     
fundamentally creative process whereby new information and structure generated so with they you mean by creative     
48:56     
process is that there's this new information and structure that you see here you go from disorder here to order     
49:04     
and it isn't just about like the up and down regulation of genes there's this     
49:10     
this biophysical part of this which is important to get this also regulated in a way that you can get say you know you     
49:18     
don't go too far uh it there's a it's sort of a happy medium is is p formation     
49:26     
is uh you have this sort of totally random State this totally clustered     
49:31     
State and then it's something in between that and so that is what they mean by creative process that that regulation     
49:39     
ends up in this creative process that creates this kind of order that is you     
49:44     
know beneficial the organism or at least beneficial the organisms we see out     
49:49     
there today um and so they they talk about this sort     
49:55     
of the key features of self-organization here um you know they they throw out a     
50:02     
lot of terms in this um and so they talk about actually what people have talked about in books     
50:10     
so in a lot of the literature there are a couple of features of     
50:16     
self-organization that people kind of focus on the first is that biological systems comprise a hierarchy of length     
50:23     
scales so you know you start from like the small scale of interactions between     
50:28     
cells to tissues to organs or you know you have like these     
50:35     
local interactions or these Global interactions and this forms a hierarchy so it's a functional hierarchy if you     
50:42     
think about a tissue it has subcomponents and so forth two is at the lowest scale in a     
50:47     
given system independent entities interact locally so there is a lot of uh     
50:53     
local interaction as we mentioned in the other papers there is a complex structur as or     
51:00     
patterns show up seemingly spontaneously at higher scales due to the interactions at the lowest scale so     
51:07     
cells that are interacting like we saw in the first paper you know they form these Junctions and they do things you     
51:14     
know large scale things like heal wounds or form structures and     
51:19     
development and then for a structure pattern formation is not coordinated in a centralized way there's no     
51:26     
pre-existing molder template uh so that that that's from these citations     
51:32     
Collective cell migration exemplifies these features cell cell and cell substrate adhesion repulsion poity     
51:39     
alignment and other local interactions give rise to Collective cell movements with strikingly large tail structures     
51:46     
such as flocks and fingers we kind of saw that with the organoids where they're forming even outside the tissue     
51:53     
they're able to recapitulate that um that microenvironmental Niche where you     
51:59     
know they can kind of do similar things to what's happening in the intestine in a culture so this is interesting uh the     
52:07     
way that this kind of is defined they actually propose a uh fifth key feature     
52:12     
of self organizing systems uh which is that they require an external energy source if the energy     
52:19     
sources is removed self-organized order decays so this is again with o with     
52:25     
respect to open systems in biology but it'll also elsewhere the idea that a     
52:31     
closed system will degenerate an open system will remain viable and so this is     
52:37     
a little bit harder to like understand in terms of development but you know you have to think about like you know maybe     
52:43     
like an an embryo maybe like a seed or an embryo that doesn't have like water     
52:48     
or energy or something like that it doesn't develop so these are kind of you     
52:54     
know things that are mentioned in the literature uh and then you know they get     
53:00     
into this idea of reciprocal causality so that means that     
53:05     
when you have causality in One Direction that's not enough uh they talk about     
53:11     
this is kind of a first principle in development um and so they basically     
53:17     
talk about molecular signals and Collective cell mechanics as being one mechanism for this uh reciprocal     
53:24     
causality so you get molecular signals that are acting and cell mechanics that are     
53:30     
acting to sort of mediate those molecular signals as we saw in the organoid example and in the other     
53:37     
examples as well um these tissue geometries establish local differences     
53:43     
in cell packing and morphology which associate with local differences in some protein     
53:49     
concentration and activation and sulfate so this is you know again     
53:55     
uh a set of things that sort of interact with one another and form this reciprocal     
54:01     
Loop reciprocal causality need not involve specific molecules as causal factors but can instead involve     
54:08     
simultaneous mechanical exchanges between two material entities analogous     
54:13     
to liquid crystals must myoblast under circular confinement move in a line in     
54:18     
such a way that they exhibits a single topological defect resulting in a spiral     
54:23     
configuration at low dens it or an aster configuration at a higher density so     
54:29     
this is again going back to this literature on liquid crystals and soft     
54:35     
materials so this is really kind of a nice paper I don't want to go through the whole thing we're kind of at the end     
54:41     
of our time for this hour but I just wanted to present those four papers that kind of present a set of ideas and and     
54:48     
kind of you know it kind of feeds into some of the things we've been talking about with biophysics but also with self     
54:54     
organization systems so I don't know if we want to     
55:00     
have a discussion about that or we have     
55:06     
thoughts     
55:23     
yeah oh thank you for presentation actually it's not uh my full of     
55:29     
expertise but I've been in contact with Susan if there is any uh anything related to computational     
55:37     
simulations that would need coding uh I would be glad to uh participate and if     
55:44     
you are also working on uh some related biophysical uh topics some some reles uh     
55:51     
I would be glad to participate on the especially on the programming part uh     
55:57     
and somehow on the on the uh actually I would be maybe could be participate and     
56:04     
add some something to for for the programing part but would uh be     
56:09     
interested in uh learning something new for the     
56:15     
biomechanical and biophysical simulation to add something to my knowledge as well     
56:22     
so uh I would be glad if there is any onra work to us     
56:29     
today yeah that's great yeah I'll keep you posted on that     
56:37     
yeah so I know we're a bit limited because Susan usually has like a lot to say about those kind of papers     
56:44     
but yeah I've been once in contacted her and there talking about how she's she     
56:50     
working on her uh phes and uh     
56:56     
yeah uh I guess it was it could be really interesting for her if she were a     
57:02     
I guess she's uh on holiday maybe or something like that said     
57:14     
yeah I could come up with some short uh updates for my words for the     
57:20     
next spe interested yeah I think that'd be great yeah     
57:27     
uh Morgan or Jesse did you have anything to     
57:33     
add yeah yeah that's great yeah thank you for attending the meeting um so yeah     
57:39     
if we have any other questions let me know uh and we'll talk next     
57:45     
week thank you have a good week thank you goodbye by now I'd like to follow up     
57:52     
on some ideas uh in the last paper about reciprocal causality I want to interpret that in     
57:59     
terms of maybe like classical cybernetics and in terms of feedback loops and in terms of what that might     
58:06     
look like in a cell or in a tissue so let's start out with sort of a     
58:11     
classical first order feedback closed loop cybernetic     
58:17     
system so start with our input and our input is usually Something That We're     
58:23     
inputting to the cell so we think about like maybe we talked about biophysical     
58:30     
constraints or like pressure input pressure sensation of the cell you know     
58:35     
the cell Encounters in its environment so that input goes to this     
58:41     
controller and this controller is basically going to integrate things in the system and you'll have this first order     
58:48     
feedback loop that tells the controller what needs to change based on the system     
58:53     
and then the system state has an output so our controller in this in this     
58:59     
case is the cell state so for example in a stem cell     
59:06     
experiment I have a stem cell which is in a certain State and I want to do     
59:11     
things to make the cell differentiate so I might deliver some sort of pressure cues I might deliver     
59:18     
some sort of viral Vector that allows the cell to reprogram there are number of inputs that I can put into the cell     
59:26     
state that will change the state but what it isn't necessarily     
59:33     
changed at this first point which is the controller the controller is merely taking signals from the input and then     
59:41     
passing it to the system which might be like a gene     
59:47     
Network and then that Gene network has some there's some effect there that     
59:52     
gives a feedback signal to the cell state so this is feed back this is feed forward cell State basically is taking     
59:59     
this information from the environment passing it onto the gene Network as a feed forward signal and then getting     
1:00:06     
feedback from the gene Network after the effect has happened and then that determines what the effect is on the     
1:00:12     
cell State and eventually we can get enough of this feed forward signal so that the G networks uh whatever changes     
1:00:20     
happening in the gene Network feed back to the cell and the cell can change its state so we can measure the cell State     
1:00:28     
at C at the the state of the controller or we can measure the gene Network State     
1:00:35     
of the State of the system independent of feedback but of course it's not     
1:00:40     
really independent of feedback because the feedback will tell the cell State you know what what it should be and the     
1:00:47     
contributions of this input the contributions of this feedback will provide us with an indicator of the cell     
1:00:54     
State and then there's an additional feedforward signal from the cell state that affects subsequent iterations of     
1:01:01     
the gene Network so the gene Network and the cell state are tied the uh     
1:01:07     
environmental input is tied to the endogenous activity of this Gene Network     
1:01:12     
and then that provides feedback and so there's just reciprocal causality and     
1:01:17     
that is the contributions of this feed forward signal and this feedback signal     
1:01:22     
that gives us a final output signal which is the integration of cell state in the gene Network and we can do this     
1:01:30     
over time so we can measure this as sort of a dynamical system or sort of a Time     
1:01:35     
series so t 0 One n meaning that we can measure it     
1:01:42     
at any point in time and thing will evolve according to what's going on in the     
1:01:48     
network if we think about those contributions we have our feed forward signal and our feedb signal     
1:01:55     
and what's interesting here is that the feedforward signal you know it could be something like     
1:02:01     
pressure it could be something like um you know our what we talked about these     
1:02:06     
cell Junctions these Tri Junctions or these fourfold Junctions or these     
1:02:11     
Eightfold Junctions and one of the things that it's doing there is it's exchanging things so we could say cell     
1:02:19     
exchange and of course as we know in that case those sell exchange uh     
1:02:25     
parameters are always changing so we can do um we can basically have these these     
1:02:33     
uh a variety of feedforward signals that are affecting the cell state but also     
1:02:39     
affecting that Gene Network so it can provide feedback to the cell state so it's correcting the cell State I can     
1:02:45     
introduce pressure to a stem cell it might remain a stem cell until it gets a feedback signal from the gene     
1:02:52     
Network that will Pro provide um some sort of instructive cue to differentiate     
1:02:59     
now the way of looking at that of course is purely in terms of feedback as a     
1:03:04     
consequence of the feed forward signal but you can also have endogenous feedback from the gene Network so we     
1:03:12     
could have you know endogenous activity which usually means like that     
1:03:17     
there's some activity some ground state of the G network you know where it's on or it's     
1:03:23     
off we can also have noise and noise can sometimes facilitate things in     
1:03:30     
systems uh but also you can have these signals and they sort of guide maybe     
1:03:36     
turn on and turn off certain genes so we know that they're you know we often use in experiments we use uh markers so     
1:03:44     
something is Paso positive Paso one positive for example that means that     
1:03:50     
that uh Gene for that protein is being expressed and we can actually get um and know use     
1:03:58     
that as an indicator of whether there's significant feedback or not so uh you     
1:04:04     
know marker positive     
1:04:09     
expression and again it's not so much that that marker is is responsible for what's going on it's that it serves as a     
1:04:16     
way to it is an indicator as to whether or not that signal is actually     
1:04:21     
feedback so we have feedback with can be endogenous activity marker uh positive     
1:04:27     
expression we have feed forward which are these environmental cues and the idea here is that these environmental     
1:04:34     
cues you know can say and and let me do this um so we can     
1:04:41     
have like an input and this is actually a feed forward the cell state so our     
1:04:47     
cell State basically if we say if our cell encounters something in the     
1:04:53     
environment it's probably not sufficient for that environmental queue to change the cell     
1:04:59     
State just by encountering the cell so in other words if the cell encounters uh     
1:05:04     
pressure a pressure gradient it's not going to change its state just on its own it's going to have to involve a     
1:05:11     
number of things and there are a lot of things we could have in the system and just simplifying this for the case of     
1:05:17     
demonstration we have this Gene Network and there's a feed another feed     
1:05:23     
for which signal here so the feed forward signal from say the environment to the cell state is exists but it's not     
1:05:32     
enough alone to trigger any sort of change we also have this feed forward     
1:05:37     
signal from the environment to the gene network but that in itself is not enough     
1:05:43     
to change the system necessarily what what may change the     
1:05:48     
system is this first order feedback and when I say first order feedback I mean that there's this immediate Loop between     
1:05:56     
this feed forward signal from cell state to Gene Network and then feedback which     
1:06:01     
is what the state of the gene network is after it's encountered the signal so you     
1:06:09     
a lot of times if you have something like pressure or something like uh you know crowding or I think there other     
1:06:15     
chemical cues that we might consider to be correlates of of biophysics or you     
1:06:21     
know uh cell cell communication you often get signals that are transducted     
1:06:27     
and converted into signals that trigger genes in their expression so that's what     
1:06:32     
I mean by the the signal being a feed forward to the gene Network the effects of that then have a     
1:06:38     
feedback on the cell state so there's a causality here between environment     
1:06:46     
and like activity and then a reverse uh a     
1:06:52     
reciprocal causality between activity and     
1:07:00     
state okay and so one could misinterpret that     
1:07:06     
as sort of the causality of environment in     
1:07:12     
state if one were to look at it very simply and say well look you know if I poke this cell with uh an environmental     
1:07:19     
stimulus it changes its state so that must mean that the environmental stimulus is changing its state well     
1:07:25     
that's not as simple as it is it's not as simple as that because you're actually triggering things within this     
1:07:31     
network and you have this reciprocal causality between maybe like you know an     
1:07:37     
environmental signal and you could do this experimentally by testing you know     
1:07:42     
like a gradient of environmental signals or testing it and seeing you know how     
1:07:47     
often the environmental signal triggers some change in the gene Network which then triggers a change in the cell state     
1:07:54     
state so you know thinking about it in this way in terms of uh reciprocal     
1:07:59     
causality in terms of a system is much more useful than thinking about it just in terms of a single cause and effect     
1:08:09     
relationship and so this is something that you know and again one of the problems in biology is that you know we     
1:08:15     
have really problems of context it's like understanding what the context is of some uh stimulus and what the     
1:08:23     
responses it's the same thing with behaviors that emerge from the brain you know it's hard to really kind of get a     
1:08:30     
handle on like simple cause and effect relationships and this is maybe one     
1:08:35     
reason why because we have this reciprocal causality now what's a more more fun     
1:08:41     
exercise is to think of the system not just as a single entity but to think of     
1:08:47     
this as like a very wide ranging Network so we can think of the you know we can     
1:08:53     
have our our controller which is here cell State we have all these different Gene networks which are systems so we     
1:09:00     
have these different systems that are affected by or maybe are a part of cell State and     
1:09:07     
so we have all these systems that exist out here and we have all these feedforward signals going     
1:09:13     
from environment cell state to these systems and so you know when we say like     
1:09:20     
that cell state is passing on when we say that state is passing on a     
1:09:26     
signal we just mean that it's its reference point is at time one so I can     
1:09:33     
take this input signal that feed forwards the cell State at time one the cell state is a stem cell and then at     
1:09:40     
time two that feed forward signal is relayed to the gene Network and then at     
1:09:47     
time three there's a feedback from the gene Network back to the cell State and     
1:09:53     
then at time time three if there's a change there then that's what we record so we actually have this time series     
1:10:00     
where we're measuring the system the controller at discrete States we're     
1:10:05     
getting the signal integrated through either through simple causality     
1:10:10     
or um reciprocal causality and then that's giving us uh you know a you know     
1:10:17     
a measurement at say like time three and then whatever effects subsequent effects     
1:10:23     
that feed forward signal has then that's captured in later time periods but it's not as simple as that     
1:10:30     
because we have all these feedback signals that are a consequence     
1:10:36     
of you know getting like a a communication relay back from the gene     
1:10:42     
expression or the gene Network to the cell state so all these feedbacks are different orders this actually these are     
1:10:49     
all order uh first order feedbacks but if you but if you have uh say like a     
1:10:56     
relay of Gene networks you can have things like second and third or     
1:11:02     
feedbacks where you know there's a distance between the relay of feed     
1:11:07     
forward signals and the feedback signal so if I have a feed forward     
1:11:14     
signal that goes say which is a first order feed     
1:11:22     
forward that goes to this Gene Network that's just a simple signal that gets relayed     
1:11:28     
forward but imagine that this Gene Network then has something that happens to it it transforms this information and     
1:11:35     
then it passes that transformed information onto another Gene networ and then this happens     
1:11:42     
again so this information is pretty transformed and it's it's it's you know     
1:11:47     
in a different kind of mode you know it may be that the signal is you know     
1:11:53     
embedded noise it could be that the signal was refined but we have this     
1:11:58     
transformation of signal this feedforward signal then if we give a feedback signal back to the     
1:12:06     
controller you know this is a very different feedback signal than the feed     
1:12:11     
forward that's coming in from the environment so we can actually get this is called a third     
1:12:18     
order feedback and this third order is much different than may be like a first     
1:12:24     
order feedback because the first order feedback might be like a simple difference so we might say that this     
1:12:31     
transformation here actually this feed forward to this Gene Network here gives us a first uh A first order feedback     
1:12:40     
which is maybe like the difference between the original feed forward signal     
1:12:46     
and the feedback signal but in a third order system it's a lot more complicated and it could be like a very complicated     
1:12:52     
mathematical trans form it could be a very convoluted signal that gets fed     
1:12:57     
back but it is feedback you know you can think about this in terms of if you have     
1:13:04     
a circle of people and you start a story off in one one person at the head of the     
1:13:10     
circle and they pass the story on to people around the circle sequentially and the story will make it     
1:13:16     
back to the original person who told the story but at every step that story is     
1:13:22     
mutated some way so that it's changed by the retelling and so by the     
1:13:28     
time it gets back to the original teller it may or may not be unintelligible it verges on     
1:13:35     
unintelligible and this is sort of the thing with third third order feedback or higherorder feedback is that it's going     
1:13:41     
to be maybe unintelligible maybe it's embedded in a lot of noise maybe it's     
1:13:46     
not something that looks anything like the original feed forward signal but this is something that still happens in     
1:13:53     
a lot of systems and something that is actually somewhat useful to the system     
1:13:58     
as something like cell State a controller which you know basically     
1:14:03     
tells maybe it provides robustness maybe it tells the sell you know additional     
1:14:09     
information but what's happening Downstream and so forth so there are a lot of things that are going on here I     
1:14:16     
wanted to present uh a little bit of a sort of an you know set of ideas about reciprocal     
1:14:24     
causality feed forwards feedbacks and they rule in biological systems and complex biological     
1:14:31     
systems and so you know the final word on this is that if you think about a system that gets built up in terms of     
1:14:38     
complexity you know often times if you're building from like a cell to a tissue to an organ first of all you're     
1:14:45     
reusing parts so a lot of these networks are modular and a lot of these sets of     
1:14:51     
feedback loops and feed forward uh motifs are modular so they're going to     
1:14:56     
be repeated across say like cells and tissues and even     
1:15:03     
organs the second word here is that you do have the these complex cases that I     
1:15:08     
showed later in this uh talk are more common than not so this first order     
1:15:15     
feedback example is this a is a toy model it doesn't really give you any biological Insight it may be a very     
1:15:22     
simple system but in these cases it's not as simple and so you see the proliferation of complexity here and you     
1:15:30     
see the variety of feed feedback signals from a single feedforward signal so you     
1:15:35     
can have you know multiple copies of that feedforward information go to different places and then the controller     
1:15:42     
gets feedback from all these different places A diversity of feedbacks both in terms of where they come from what the     
1:15:49     
Transformations were and then this ordering effect where you get this third order message that's very different from     
1:15:57     
the kind of feedback you would get in a first order message and so these are the     
1:16:03     
kinds of things you know and then the reciprocal causality part comes from the notion that you know feedback is just as     
1:16:09     
important as the feed forward that the feedback is kind of pulling back on the feed forward it's kind of correcting it     
1:16:16     
or sometimes it's contradicting it but it maybe in a in a way that regulates     
1:16:22     
the system to C Direction so this reciprocal causality it's kind of hard to uh really see I I     
1:16:30     
didn't give any really good examples but if you look at like any paper on     
1:16:35     
different types you know they'll do experiments on a on a a gene what they'll call Gene circuit or a set of     
1:16:41     
candidate genes they'll say you know this thing is upregulated and then downregulates some other Gene and then     
1:16:47     
an uppr we something else and uh and you see this in brain activity too the     
1:16:53     
different brain regions or neurons can inhibit or you know pass on an     
1:16:59     
excitation signal in fact a lot of times in in neuronal networks you have this in     
1:17:05     
this Festival of inhibition where the inhibition it's always about the cell     
1:17:11     
you know the output being an inhibition signal to the next cell and that's how     
1:17:18     
you you kind of gain control so the feedback is actually inhibiting the feed     
1:17:23     
forward signal and so that's the causality that's the reciprocal causality the     
1:17:30     
information is going outward to some entity that's then returning the signal     
1:17:35     
that's causing it to sort of pull back and so there are lot of examples of this     
1:17:41     
in like biologically Orient oriented cybernetics uh one famous example is     
1:17:47     
rain control and it's like driving a sleigh where you have two rains and you     
1:17:52     
have to pull on one side and then pull on the other and you have to do this in a certain you know sequence or Rhythm to     
1:17:59     
really get full control over the system so you know there are a lot of different uh metaphors we can use to sort of     
1:18:06     
describe control and describe this uh reciprocal causality but that's uh that's all I'm     
1:18:14     
going to say about that I think you know the the Quest for causality people get hung up on this question and it's     
1:18:21     
usually the way they think about it is that one way it's like this thing causes that thing what I'm showing you here is     
1:18:27     
that actually reciprocal causality is really about one thing causing something     
1:18:32     
else but then being sort of moderated by something you know by that thing that's     
1:18:39     
being cont or being affected feeding back to that original     
1:18:45     
thing so thank you for paying attention and hope you learned something
