hello hello how are you good I'm having breakfast oh good     
0:10     
yeah hello Le Pang and Pocky nice to see     
0:17     
you I won't be sorry I won't be joining you next week okay right hello Hi how     
0:24     
are you okay uh okay there you go F perfect there we go     
0:31     
okay good okay so what we're going to do here is very strange we're g to take you     
0:38     
we're going to take a picture and scratch a few lines across it and try to reconstruct the picture just from the     
0:45     
lines okay okay okay so uh the context     
0:51     
of this is that we're building up towards algorithms for breast compression mamography where the x-rays     
0:57     
go into the top and H A detect at the bottom here breast will be in between these two plates now the reason for     
1:05     
compressing the breast is that you get a better image if it's thinner okay so usually they compress it     
1:11     
until it hurts uh the standard seems to be about 5 cm and these things are 25 by about 25     
1:18     
by 25 cmers so that gives you the SI size of the volume that you'll eventually have to deal     
1:24     
with Okay now what's happened in the last couple of decades     
1:31     
is that a new kind of oh excuse me a     
1:41     
second hello hi I'm I'm online can is do you need to talk to me right     
1:51     
now I'll call you back later okay     
1:58     
bye okay wasn't that or okay     
2:04     
now what happened in the last 20 years or so is that a new source of x-rays has     
2:09     
been developed this this is the X-ray generating unit can you see my mouse yes     
2:16     
yes okay the x-rays come in here and they go through a set of glass tubes     
2:24     
called capillaries okay and uh and then they     
2:30     
come out either parallel or focused depending on the type of tube of glass     
2:36     
tubes you're using or or the or the shape of them now this is this is what it looks like here's the X-ray Source     
2:45     
the x-rays go into these tubes and uh for the case I'm talking about today they come out     
2:51     
parallel okay and what happens is the the way this works the x-rays are very     
2:57     
hard to focus or to move to change their Direction the way this works is these     
3:03     
are very tiny capillaries and the x-rays Bounce by total internal reflection     
3:09     
inside the tubes the tubes have nothing in them but air okay this is what they look like if     
3:16     
you look at them with a microscope they're only 10 microns in width the individual tubes and there are millions     
3:23     
of them okay so you can't see them uh without a without a microscope     
3:30     
okay so each one is hollow and the x-rays bounce inside okay so what I'm going to do is show you what we've done     
3:36     
with a test image so this is what done by Ken Chen and I uh okay we we started     
3:43     
with this gray scale picture okay now I have to discuss uh straight lines across a     
3:52     
picture I straight line has done naively is what's called     
3:58     
alias in other words a St if you draw a straight line across a checkerboard uh it's it's a bunch of     
4:05     
steps uh it can be in this case it's two or three steps what most people deal     
4:10     
with are anti-alias where you youh use an algorithm to smooth to make that line     
4:17     
look Smoother by making some of the pixels next to those uh grayscale     
4:23     
pictures we're not going to deal with that we're dealing only with Alias     
4:28     
lines okay so we're we're bucking the trend so to     
4:34     
speak okay so here is that butterfly with a bunch of uh with two to the fifth     
4:41     
lines what's that 32 yeah yeah okay 32 lines and you can     
4:46     
just barely see the butterfly okay yeah now what we did next     
4:53     
is we used an infilling algorithm which is a very simple one it's uh we you     
5:01     
let's go back here if you take a single row across the butterfly with just lines     
5:07     
what it does is each each pixel on the line has been extracted from the     
5:13     
butterfly so each pixel could have a different value you take a row across     
5:18     
here and you take two consecutive lines and you interpolate between the lines     
5:23     
just a simple linear interpolation so you fill in the pi in     
5:30     
between the two lines in the row by interpolating and this is the     
5:37     
result okay so just just a simp and this is a very simple-minded uh     
5:42     
inpainting okay now uh I want to point out that this is the opposite of the general practice of inpainting at least     
5:50     
when it got started here's a here's a parrot somebody has crudely by hand     
5:56     
drawn the the cage lines here and then they in paint the lines and you get your     
6:02     
parrot without outside of the cage okay okay what we're doing is we in     
6:11     
paint between the lines the lines have the data and we throw away the     
6:17     
rest okay now this this shows uh this is a power     
6:25     
of two we we did it backwards here but uh with this power of     
6:31     
two at uh 2 to the 9th lines you get the     
6:37     
full picture back but if you if you use fewer lines this is the ukian distance     
6:42     
between the line image and the original but if you in paint the ukian distance     
6:48     
goes down drastically okay so this this is gives     
6:53     
us a quantitative measure of uh how well we're doing okay now here instead of of     
6:59     
vertical lines we use random lines top B now I the reason we use top to bottom     
7:08     
goes back to this this slide and that is the x-rays can only go up and down from     
7:15     
through through this compression plate to the array of detectors so they can't     
7:21     
go sideways so we're sticking just with the case where where they're nearly     
7:27     
vertical but uh but not quite okay so if we go let's see if we go here let's see     
7:35     
there we go so if we take a bunch of random lines here again you can vaguely see the     
7:43     
butterfly okay uh see what happened here oh okay     
7:52     
but if we do our infilling the butterfly is clearly there there are obviously     
7:58     
artifacts in this infilling because we're only doing horizontal infilling okay and as you can see we're     
8:07     
doing even better here with the infilling pulls it down to these values this is without the     
8:15     
infilling ter equility distance okay now what we're aimed at eventually     
8:23     
is what I call Ray byray computer tomography uh you have to understand     
8:28     
that x-rays are ordinally emitted over a large area if you've ever had an x-ray they're sprayed over your over your body     
8:36     
and they're going gets out on the room okay they may be that's called a cone     
8:42     
that's called a cone beam where the x-rays come out and Cone they may be columnated through a lead slit the lead     
8:49     
will stop the x-rays and then you get what's called a van be and there are thousands of papers on SE computer     
8:56     
tomography algorithms for both cone and fan beams rays are what     
9:02     
are in computer tomography with our pencil     
9:09     
beams okay so this is a new problem now let's see next     
9:17     
slide okay this this illustrates then here's a cone beam goes through a     
9:25     
large portion of the patient here's a fan beam just goes through a a plane of     
9:32     
the patient and here's our our x-rays which could be aimed in any direction     
9:37     
because we in at least in in the initial prototype we'll carry the X-ray Source     
9:42     
by a a robot okay and it has to be a a strong     
9:47     
robot it's weighs a couple of kilograms okay so it's an industrial strength     
9:54     
robot okay now oops     
10:02     
okay so uh what we need is better inpainting algorithms which have it's     
10:09     
apparently a very sophisticated field that's gone from uh differential     
10:14     
equation approaches to machine learning nowadays and uh we could probably do     
10:21     
significantly better than what we've done uh like this so in other words this curve here with the in painting might     
10:27     
come lower with better in in painting algorithms okay so if anybody's familiar     
10:33     
with in painting it be nice to nice to have okay next question how do you     
10:41     
choose the lines okay and the question is would     
10:46     
image dependent image processing help in other words if you chosen n lines to choose the N plus one line do you look     
10:53     
at what you've got so far and somehow figure out where to put the next line instead of putting them in random     
11:00     
uh we tried one way of doing that and it didn't help so it obviously needs some     
11:07     
thinking okay now the other thing is what's the difference between X-rays and taking a line out of a picture the     
11:12     
difference is very simple and that is xrays give you only the average value of     
11:19     
all the pixels along the line they don't give you the individual pixels okay and uh we have to minimize     
11:28     
the number of do number of lines because every line is an x-ray and the more     
11:33     
x-rays the more dose and breast tissue is very sensitive to to problem Oh I     
11:39     
should have mentioned that uh one out of eight women experience breast cancer in their     
11:45     
lives okay at least according to North American statistics it may be worse outside of North     
11:51     
America we have to generalize these algorithms to three dimensions because we're dealing with three dimensional     
11:57     
breast and it's it's been shown that the normal breast tissue can be     
12:02     
characterized by what's called pearlin noise so we have to see if we can do     
12:08     
this in in terms of a background of pear noise and not a clean background like     
12:14     
I've been assuming okay and     
12:19     
uh uh one problem is we the way we like to if you find a tumor and we're look     
12:25     
we're looking for 2 to four millimeter tumors before the before this is the     
12:31     
size at which most tumors have not yet metastized which means they haven't spread around the body so you got a     
12:38     
chance of curing the patient okay and uh we're thinking of     
12:43     
doing it using polycap resources which are focused and that so the glass tubes     
12:48     
are bent this way to a focus so you would aim the tumor would be here at the focus you would destroy     
12:55     
try to destroy the tumor and you'd also use the robot to go around and do it in     
13:01     
different directions so that you gave as little radiation as possible to the normal     
13:07     
tissue and mostly hit the T hit the tumor     
13:13     
uh okay so that's uh that's the problem we're aiming at and here are some     
13:19     
suggestions using uh the mark probably within painting the multiplicative art     
13:25     
algorithm the power Mark which takes the correction factor to a power uh the use     
13:33     
of boids and machine learning okay so uh we     
13:38     
got a lot to do so that's that's it okay okay that's great okay any     
13:47     
questions losing ouch yes only uh breast     
13:53     
cancer occurs 1% in males that uh spreads the ouch yeah     
14:00     
okay so usually usually uh they're concerned with females ma males also are     
14:07     
uh very stubborn they come in late and it's usually too late to try to cure them um I I know some women that refuse     
14:15     
to go get it done oh yes I believe I I believe you uh you know and they're trying to modify those breast padal so     
14:22     
that the force exerted is acceptable well they they have fixed it a bit Yeah     
14:31     
Yeah but still the images aren't great because they're they're just projection images in One     
14:36     
Direction okay we're trying to go we're trying to find tumors in three dimensions and cure the patient the idea     
14:43     
is while you're still in the machine if a tumor is found the machine zaps it and     
14:49     
you're cured okay so that's the idea yeah and there's one paper suggesting that these     
14:55     
things will destroy uh small tumors so uh we seem to be     
15:01     
okay uh I don't understand P's uh what did I say that     
15:08     
means to which you want to reply yeah exactly exactly the Susan the Susan's     
15:13     
ouch oh oh yes yes yeah women yes     
15:19     
they're getting better at it but uh the the problem is that uh if you just take     
15:24     
a standard flat x-ray image uh of anything uh or or like you're not you're     
15:32     
not likely to find you're not going to find if you see tumors you won't know where they are in three dimensions and     
15:39     
so we have to go after some sort of three-dimensional calculation oh Le Pang can't can't see     
15:46     
you okay oh he's on well get your camera     
15:52     
fixed okay uh lee is it how do you pronounce your name L Lee or lie     
16:04     
okay not can maybe maybe I hope he heard what I was talking     
16:09     
about okay so that's that's the general problem uh you can see it needs a lot of work it     
16:16     
needs more testing on all pictures and it certainly needs better inpainting algs yeah uh I invented this extremely     
16:24     
simple-minded paint in painting algorithm because the other ones were too hard for me     
16:30     
yeah so yeah I had a couple of questions about the slides so the ukan distance is     
16:37     
measuring what exactly what is the distance it's it's just the Idan distance between all of the pixels     
16:43     
corresponding pixels normalized okay okay we yeah we we     
16:49     
normalized it so soting I think the scale is     
16:57     
z yeah go that back yeah yeah I think it's zero to one in other words this Plateau     
17:06     
well when when you have a small number of lines the average distance is 04 that's     
17:13     
dist that's the I think it's the square root of the some of the squares of the distances between the     
17:20     
pixels okay okay I have something have had something     
17:36     
the Ved your voice is breaking up could you please use the uh uh chat     
17:44     
yes I couldn't understand your voice is it okay now yeah it's     
17:50     
better yeah yes it's okay okay go okay okay uh I saying uh in the past     
17:57     
some some the fitting problems we were dealing with uh were something like this I couldn't actually get the right     
18:05     
message from uh what's what's the problem you are going to solve but uh I     
18:11     
might be actually help yeah in an optimization or fitting     
18:16     
problem like this okay this distance here uh can you still see my     
18:24     
picture yes yes yes okay the distance here is typically     
18:29     
a fraction of a millimeter okay so that you you're getting a beam of of     
18:37     
x-rays okay that that's what you get in the in the real case now what we're doing here is not using a beam of x-rays     
18:45     
we're just taking lines extracted from the original     
18:50     
picture you know so you know if you extract all of them you get you get the original picture which is this is the     
18:57     
original okay if we extract them that then you get these but you get zeros in between     
19:03     
because you Haven to extract those pixels and then infilling between the     
19:10     
lines this is the kind of picture we get so you get a tremendous Improvement within     
19:15     
filling okay however there are obvious artifacts here you can see the horizontal artifacts     
19:22     
everywhere okay and then something like it's it seems something an interp     
19:29     
interpolation problem yeah so here yeah this is the this is the power     
19:37     
of two of the number of lines we add two at the edges but the Computing uh the uh algorithm is     
19:46     
uniform uh in other words uh here if we go back here there's actually a line     
19:51     
here at the left Edge and one at the right Edge that's where the two the 5th line lines plus     
19:58     
the left and right edges okay by doing that we just have to interpolate the same way here as     
20:06     
here okay it it simplifies the program okay uh if we use random lines     
20:15     
this is what we get you said okay but still still even with     
20:21     
random lines it's pretty good ough we we had we had the the number of lines went     
20:27     
up by a effect 10 to get     
20:33     
this okay now you you can use other distance measures than ukian ukian is     
20:39     
just simplest yes okay but it's remarkable     
20:45     
how how well in painting does and then you can you can     
20:50     
see you know you can see your basically your error here in the uh in the uh     
20:57     
average this is only even even at 2 to the 5ifth here uh the average is only     
21:04     
0.1 uh of the pixel okay so it's pretty good so the     
21:11     
the problem is to get this curve as low as possible I think better in inpainting algorithms would do     
21:16     
that this inpainting algorithm which does it horizontally uh is very crude I invented     
21:23     
it myself and it's it's obvious okay but even it's it is it's pretty     
21:33     
good as you mentioned usually us the problems with the the right initial     
21:39     
value choosing yeah so I like I have had some actually similar uh     
21:49     
problems that I could solve with some uh using some ivp better than uh maybe some     
21:56     
other types of uh culation so if I could delve into the problem maybe I could be     
22:03     
I could help on and having a better High     
22:09     
measurements so I would be glad to help me this this something okay uh you want     
22:16     
to give me your email address I can send you the uh the latest draft of the     
22:23     
manuscript put it in I guess you have it but     
22:28     
I have it not in my head maybe somewhere in     
22:36     
my I was gonna ask if you published it yet not quite right no it hasn't been     
22:41     
published yet uh uh worst case it will go into a book that we will eventually     
22:47     
write on whole problem but uh uh know it hasn't been published yet it would be     
22:53     
nice to add uh better in painting algorithms see how they work and if you     
23:00     
do that you'll be a co-author okay there you go     
23:07     
um no maybe that's a challenge anyone could could do a better job     
23:13     
maybe I'm just I'm just challenging myself as well okay that's fine okay so     
23:19     
the ba basic difference here then if I go back to the Lines line image the basic difference is     
23:27     
that along each line instead you see if you look at an individual line here you see the density     
23:33     
varies okay with x-rays you only get the average of all the pixels along the     
23:40     
line that's the difference and that's where we have to get into algorithms uh uh maybe Lee will do that     
23:48     
he he has experience with computer tomography okay so that will be a separate paper     
23:55     
uh that's why I uh Clos this paper number one     
24:04     
okay okay uh just just wanted to mention that I have prepared something as well     
24:10     
if there is any time at the end I would be happy to present oh yeah yeah that would be great yeah I've been teching to     
24:18     
Brad in the past yeah if there's any time if not I I     
24:25     
could postpone it to the next week yeah okay when you get it to the point where     
24:32     
it's published or something um maybe you could present this to the biomedical     
24:39     
engineering uh seminar oh sure but I it's hard to do an hour well yeah no     
24:47     
it's it's three quarters of an hour and then yeah we we we have pictures for all     
24:53     
of the numbers of lines that we used okay so I've got a about a 100 pictures     
24:58     
I really cut them down for this presentation yeah well I mean when it's     
25:07     
you worked on it further and have some 10 more slides or something it probably     
25:12     
would well it could do that yeah could do that oh I just I I just thought that     
25:17     
it would in intrigue the students I was trying trying to keep it short and sweet     
25:23     
here okay just just single examples well this is simpler than what often     
25:31     
gets presented to us oh it's more understandable     
25:38     
and I've been in lectures that I understood because I     
25:44     
understand some biochemistry and a lot of biology and the rest of the students     
25:52     
who are mechanical engineer are going ah what is this     
25:59     
right understand this assing you know something some image processing I gu have some     
26:04     
experience you like the difference between an alias and an unalias line I do know the reason the reason we     
26:13     
use the Alias line is because it allows us to just sample the picture easily if     
26:19     
you Ed an an anti-alias line you'd have these you'd sample them with weights it     
26:26     
be Loos okay so so we did the simplest     
26:34     
case okay so I wonder if you could make a few     
26:39     
words about the pearlin noise simulation so we discuss     
26:45     
that uh I I've got a paper which claims there are three kinds of tissues in     
26:51     
breast and each one has its own Pearl and Noise with different parameters and I haven't been able to figure it out yet     
26:59     
okay uh so uh you know dealing if you want to delve into pear noise you have     
27:06     
to understand this paper see if you can figure it out yeah so why why does it     
27:13     
have is that like a background noise for the image uh well it they claim that     
27:19     
it's the noise looks the same as normal tissue oh okay okay so what we would do     
27:26     
is then start with picture with pearlin noid in it we would add a simulated     
27:31     
tumor and there are lots of papers on that on how to simulate a tumor you could do it simply as a as a disc Circ     
27:38     
filled in circle or they they've got more sophisticated ones where they uh     
27:43     
look at the properties of tumors uh and then the question is can     
27:49     
you detect the tumor this way using with that pein noise     
27:56     
background and it's assuming that the uh that these people are correct that they have characterized normal breast issue     
28:03     
as looking like plar noise great great okay if you're interested I can send you     
28:10     
papers on pin noise yeah and this and this paper that claims     
28:15     
the breast looks like pearlin Noise Okay uh and they're they're more     
28:22     
sophisticated yeah I only put down the simplest problems here at the end     
28:28     
uh for example uh are any of you familiar with K     
28:38     
edges you're all sh not necessarily yeah okay a kedge is     
28:44     
typically done with iodine iodine apparently concentrates     
28:50     
tumors and uh this is just I think it's just Elemental iodine uh and it absorbs     
28:58     
x-rays but it has a remarkable property that at a certain wavelength the uh uh     
29:07     
the absorption of the X-ray suddenly jumps so if you use one wavelength of X-ray and then the the other side that's     
29:14     
called the K Edge and then you get two pictures and then you can look at the difference picture between them so I we     
29:23     
may have to do this with different pictures to get rid of the Pearl and white for     
29:29     
example okay so that's that's called K kedge Imaging or differential Imaging or     
29:35     
whatever but uh the you you can locate the iodine the iodine gets into the     
29:40     
tumors and then hopefully that would help find the tumors okay and one of the problems we     
29:47     
have is that the physical properties of these tiny tumors these are 2 to four     
29:53     
millimeters uh prasis means before the tumor spread to the body uh the physical     
30:01     
properties of these are not well known okay so uh we're we're guessing at     
30:07     
them okay so so that's that's basically there there are a whole bunch of additional steps which will require a     
30:13     
lot of programming and uh we're trying to do the whole thing by simulation to see if     
30:19     
it works and we're only simulating physical things so it should be     
30:25     
possible okay yeah okay everybody know what boids     
30:31     
are well we've talked about them in the group but you might want to yeah yeah boy boids are uh simulations of PLS of     
30:39     
birds or schooling fish or something like that okay they can be     
30:44     
used the idea here is to uh move the pixels around as if they were boids     
30:51     
voids represent Birds computer computerized Birds but we'd have to move them back and forth on the     
30:58     
lines and let them fly on the lines and move the densities around remember with     
31:03     
the x-rays we start every pixel initially has just the average value but as the as the lines cross you can uh you     
31:11     
can improve the value so one approach is to use voids to fly them up and down the lines till we get a consistent set of uh     
31:19     
uh voids representing the uh densities along each line and then do     
31:26     
interpolation and machine learning I on this problem I don't understand how     
31:33     
it goes I mean somebody who is into machine learning needs to look into     
31:40     
that okay so it's an sort of an open-ended problem we we think we can solve it uh and uh these uh polyc     
31:50     
capillarity poly capillary sources uh now make it physically possible and     
31:56     
they're easy to simulate so uh we think it might be possibly to do     
32:01     
this problem okay so whereafter the aim of the the ultimate aim here is to search     
32:08     
out tumors find them and Destroy them and hopefully cure the     
32:14     
patient okay so uh Susan for all the pain if this works you go into the     
32:21     
machine and if you find something you come out cured yeah     
32:28     
I still think there's ought to be a a different mechanical way of doing it I keep saying well it was designed by a     
32:35     
mechanical engineer what do you expect yeah you give the woman a microphone and when she says ouch you stop     
32:42     
yeah like I said they have improved it a bit so I mean that's basically what it's     
32:49     
about but the the standard squeezing of the breast seems to be 3 to five cmers     
32:56     
yeah yeah well and it does have a reason and the reason is that you uh by going     
33:04     
through less tissue the x-rays give you better images right okay so uh there     
33:11     
there is rationale to it now there are some sad sadistic texts who will squeeze     
33:16     
to make sure it hurts well no I just said they they the     
33:22     
last time I talked to a tech she said that they had improved it a lot so um     
33:29     
that's good okay okay yeah it's it's coming it's coming along but but the pictures aren't getting any better     
33:37     
right the the problem is very simple you see uh computer tomography we're all     
33:43     
used to now if you need three if you need three-dimensional Imaging of part of your body you go to this million     
33:49     
dooll machine and it'll make a nice picture for you but the methods that are used for breast     
33:57     
Imaging haven't caught up with this yet the most they have is what's called tomosynthesis which is a very crude form     
34:04     
of computer demography okay so uh what we're after is doing it right and doing it     
34:11     
effectively okay uh the uh and the     
34:16     
reason for this is uh if I may make a it might seem like a sex hisory Mark I've     
34:22     
been in groups I've been involved with groups of women who uh try to raise money for breast cancer     
34:29     
research and what's obviously going on is that they raise the money they give it to the men the men say thank you and     
34:35     
then then go go away and they will not talk to you talk to these women again uh     
34:41     
so the problem we have is there are very few women who seriously get into breast cancer     
34:46     
research and uh and I've seen that problem over the decades the this     
34:51     
problem is not going to be solved probably until women get involved okay well there's becoming more     
34:58     
and more uh women U biomedical Engineers like um fine I haven't seen I     
35:06     
haven't seen any in breast cancer yet okay well there're um well not not quite     
35:12     
there's a woman named Carolyn McDonald who shown that she had wrote one paper     
35:17     
which shows that the focusing polycapillary sources are have sufficient energy to     
35:24     
kill tumors oh okay okay and then she did nothing for     
35:31     
it oh well I have had that done with some of my research yeah I just wrote     
35:38     
one paper it's quoted over 150 times but     
35:43     
um I didn't get to do another one yeah to get somebody to follow up and do the     
35:49     
hard work and say Okay so let's actually kill some TOS yeah yeah she didn't go for three     
35:55     
dimensions uh I've tried to get her involved she will she's not     
36:01     
interested so uh any any but the the F so but at least she's shown that the     
36:08     
focusing polycapillary sources are sufficient to kill     
36:15     
tumors the energy of these things has come up oh this would be this would be a     
36:21     
reason for you to present to the biomedical engineering students sure     
36:27     
sure just suggest a date no okay well I have to persuade a certain Dr Sharie     
36:33     
that this oh okay     
36:41     
yes Sharie is here is at the University of manobo because partly because I visit     
36:49     
visited a master's uh his recruiting talk and uh     
36:55     
uh try to convince him to come so oh okay well he I remember he in his     
37:03     
introductory speech he defended my my Master's thesis and he didn't know he     
37:12     
had it was good okay anyway if anybody wants to help this we're doing the whole     
37:18     
thing by computer simulation as I mention including the Robotics and     
37:23     
whatnot uh because we can't afford else these these uh these new polycapillary     
37:30     
sources are cheap compared to mography unit mography units go for 125,000 to     
37:39     
250,000 uh these polycapillary sources are about 30,000 didn't mention that in your talk     
37:46     
to the BME I'll I'm gonna oh okay okay     
37:52     
cool the relative clost so they they're the polycapillary sources are practical     
37:57     
in the concept of what kind of moneyy is being spent now okay and if this works it could help     
38:05     
half a billion women in the world how much how much are they again     
38:12     
um 30 30,000 to the X-ray store     
38:17     
okay poly capillary are 30,000 yeah okay price of a car sort of I think one of     
38:25     
the reasons they're so expensive that's really finicky to bend that glass so it's got the right     
38:31     
shape and how much are the other ones again well the a standard mamography     
38:37     
unit as used today costs up to 275,000 oh     
38:44     
boy okay so so you see we're we're in the B we're well within the B Park if     
38:50     
this works it's buildable at a cost probably less than that of a me standard     
38:56     
unit okay now there are all sorts of problems we right now we're carrying the X-ray     
39:02     
source with a robot which means the speed of the robot and uh how fast it     
39:09     
settles down when you move it from one position to another is probably going to be the limiting uh and anybody with robotics     
39:17     
experience maybe could help out and make some realistic estimates I think the     
39:23     
whole x-ray steering eventually the aiming of x-rays in in a parallel beam     
39:29     
in any direction you want can eventually be done electronically but that's going to take some new     
39:37     
technology okay so uh so I think I I regard the robot carrying this x-ray     
39:43     
source as a prototype not as the ultimate it it's a it's a a proof of     
39:50     
principles so to speak oh okay okay because I think it's going to beow slow     
39:57     
because a robot that can carry a couple of kilograms is not going to be a fast one     
40:03     
as far as I know but okay yeah most home home robots only     
40:10     
carry a few hundred uh uh     
40:15     
uh grams not     
40:21     
kilograms okay and obviously this program the robot uh uh making sure the     
40:27     
robot doesn't damage the other equipment uh and make sure he doesn't damage the     
40:34     
patient okay so there's some clever things that have to be done with the     
40:40     
robot okay any more questions I think that's it um yeah so     
40:47     
thank you dick once again for presenting on that okay yeah good and then Ved     
40:54     
wants to present something so would you ahead     
41:00     
okay hello again everyone yeah yeah uh actually this is     
41:07     
something we we were discussing in the past uh with BR share window all     
41:25     
right     
41:43     
yeah okay yes uh there were some questions I had in     
41:48     
mind that based on them I was going to have maybe a review paper or a new kind     
41:55     
of word uh I've been talking to Bradley uh during the past week uh I've uh     
42:02     
somehow managed to uh try to have some questions and some uh available works     
42:10     
and uh so uh what we could do by using those uh     
42:17     
kind of questions and works then the main question actually is based on uh a     
42:23     
developmental perspective to arti network models that basically could be     
42:28     
dve from seing us but also we could have some uh some type of work that could     
42:35     
help to better understand and better simulate what type of actually developmental processes could be     
42:41     
actually better simulated in Seas models especially in the loc Locomotion of seas     
42:48     
as we have done some great works in the past uh the open warm project so the the     
42:55     
main uh questions I maybe they have been answered in the past in the PO project     
43:01     
but I've maybe i' I'm trying to look at them from different uh aspects the the     
43:10     
first question is that uh what are what could be actually the main violence for C to become an adult from a Locomotion     
43:18     
point of view if there are for example uh different days that could be uh uh     
43:25     
could be uh considered as the as the as the main ones to be uh to be distinguished     
43:35     
because distinguish movement patterns uh and so if that's that's it so what uh     
43:46     
changeing the neural and so what change could be applied to the equivalent suar     
43:52     
cits that uh so far we have simulated uh similarly what could be recognize in     
44:00     
structural compartments those that could be again applied to Mechanical models of the     
44:06     
movements uh and and so if it is it possible to derive some new artificial     
44:13     
neur network based on these developmental chains and on the other hand uh could we have a chronological     
44:21     
story of development of Aral networks that could be helpful history that uh     
44:28     
I'm going to mention somehow using my the references that I have exerted so     
44:35     
far and also from a thermodynamics and energetic point of view what could be     
44:41     
considered as the main stage uh and what other environmental factors could be     
44:47     
affect the model these are maybe the main three categories that could be considered as the     
44:54     
different uh uh maybe milest for for a new work that     
45:00     
or a review work that could be done uh I'm just uh saying that it's a new uh     
45:08     
work I started maybe for two or four days that I've been delving into this so     
45:16     
uh I would be glad if you know any uh any work that have been done     
45:22     
specifically in the open project uh uh read and uh somehow exed some some of     
45:32     
those words over here but I would glad to your uh opinion as well so based on     
45:40     
these questions uh what we have in currently in the C in the project is a     
45:46     
movement simulation that uh that is that has been simulated through the     
45:51     
cybernetic project has been simulated by mechanical circuits and connecton     
45:56     
and also the current ma mathematical models and simulation for Ionic currents     
46:02     
especially muscle bodies and for for an adult her of this cagon that is based on     
46:08     
the work by Bo and Co in 2008 this is part of the project that has been     
46:16     
simulated and we have the codes both in MLB and python in at the open project     
46:23     
this is a model that they have uh mainly uh the work is based on there are some     
46:32     
different simplified model of of arms and also uh some circuits that have been     
46:40     
equivalently designed there are I guess 29 parameters in this model that they     
46:47     
they try to uh simulate the model and this is the simulated model of of of a     
46:55     
current this uh we have you could as well over here so the the main thing the     
47:03     
starting point of of this work is how we could have uh actually different stages     
47:09     
of development in C Locomotion death could generate some similar patterns and     
47:17     
models like these for different maybe States uh for example we can say the     
47:22     
first day of its movement would be the first uh key points and after that every     
47:29     
different pattern that would be recognized would be a new uh a new model     
47:35     
and so a new uh set of parameters so uh     
47:41     
what we need is uh some data for structural development and movements of     
47:46     
seon during these different stages and so after that fing some new parameters     
47:52     
to those I should the Abomination model find out uh new models for each state     
47:59     
these are the main uh maybe uh points that I'm going to refer uh during this     
48:08     
work or this review paper I started some reviews uh for what have been done in     
48:15     
the past some from maybe early days of the uh     
48:23     
Works uh Asar both and also after that some cred to in the     
48:30     
SE I I tried to uh find some main uh     
48:36     
papers and structural development and especially in modeling references that's     
48:42     
you could have and H also some other related     
48:49     
references and uh some uh important computation work and what we have done     
48:55     
we open work so far uh these are going to be the main differences that uh     
49:03     
maybe to we could collect some of EX of them and uh I try to have     
49:12     
some chats chat G as well and asking for some questions so     
49:20     
I I again I I try to have some cheap applications     
49:26     
uh I couldn't I don't know why I couldn't find any related work to to the open Worm Project during all my     
49:33     
questions but might you might D work in the future why this is happening and     
49:39     
nowh is mentioning actually open room project as as a source of uh some     
49:45     
computational models of serence um so I started with the     
49:51     
chronological of n system development C uh I could have some uh first     
49:58     
initiatives and after that uh one by one     
50:03     
uh uh making it uh improve uh and     
50:12     
finally uh I can say I could have this     
50:17     
main some that direct from sers that I'm going to to include the model and also     
50:31     
uh one which is related to what I've been talking so     
50:37     
far some differences     
50:43     
and yeah that the cute so     
50:50     
uh for the for the first part I I was interested in KN if anyone at the de     
50:59     
project because uh I mainly know that the dev project we were more focusing on     
51:06     
on on the embryo geny from from an from a actually a genetic point of view     
51:13     
that's when a when a cell when a egg when an egg hatches after that what     
51:19     
would happen uh that is somehow uh uh maybe the the one grows up     
51:29     
and become an adult but what happens in between I mean from a behavioral point     
51:35     
of view for example Behavior like a Locomotion what happens uh uh actually I     
51:42     
I was wondering uh that is there any computational and mathematical model for     
51:50     
those kind of developments that could be considered as uh as as a maybe uh a new     
51:58     
work or something that have been done in the past for uh such computational     
52:04     
most uh so oh thank you yeah well that's a very complete uh document if you could     
52:12     
send me a link to that I'd like to take a look at it course as we discussed so     
52:17     
yeah it's it's great there's a lot of stuff in there I see like that are potential things to focus on and then     
52:23     
the thing you highlighted last which was like what kinds of things are happening from like the egg you know fertilization     
52:30     
of the zygote to like you know the hatch of the egg or some or even to the adult     
52:36     
you know we we kind of know what those things are but I don't think there're any mathematical models for that so you     
52:43     
know one thing is like to look at like ion channels as they change from like a     
52:48     
undifferentiated cell to like a a mature neuron and there's a lot of actually     
52:53     
there's an area of work on bioelectricity that people have done with with not just with neurons but with     
53:00     
other types of cells so all cells even stem cells will uh Express ion channels     
53:07     
of different types and those are usually used to keep you know to regulate the electrical activity or the physiology of     
53:15     
the cell now in neurons you get very specific neuron neuron channels that are     
53:22     
of type that create a action potential and in seans you know we don't     
53:27     
necessarily think it's a full action potential but the point is is that you get this expression of ion channels     
53:33     
through development and so what are I don't think people have characterized what those are like the the progression     
53:40     
from say like any one stem cell or precursor cell type to the adult form of     
53:47     
a neuron but you know that's something you know that would be interesting to simulate because we have an openworm the     
53:54     
tools to simulate different you know neuron Channel or different ion channels and how you know how they affect the     
54:00     
cell and what kinds of potentials they generate so that might be an interesting thing to say like well we can make some     
54:07     
hypotheses about what gets expressed in the cell you know we know maybe what     
54:12     
stem cells are expressing we know what maybe uh adult cells are expressing and     
54:18     
we can work from there so there's a there's an ion Channel component to that     
54:23     
there's also maybe like a behavioral component which is that behaviors you know start with like these sort of     
54:31     
endogenous movements of the embryo so like there movements in the embryo like     
54:37     
you get a comma stage of the embryo where you know the the embryo     
54:42     
starts to take on a shape you can see it in the in the microscopy of it and then     
54:48     
you have these other endogenous movements like muscle twitching so when you get the formation you get cell     
54:54     
migration early and then you start to get like the formation of muscles you get muscle     
55:00     
twitching but it's not like controlled by the the nervous system that's controlled just by like its own     
55:05     
electrical activity and then you start to get the uh brain or the nervous     
55:11     
system wired to the muscles the the connections make it to the muscles and then you start to get maybe some     
55:17     
behavior and so you know it's kind of interesting that progression of different movements uh from from the embryo to the     
55:25     
to the the actually we end up with the first Lal period so the in L1 or the     
55:31     
first laral period is where we start to get these sort of movements that are autonomous and actually are directed     
55:39     
towards like food or something like that but mainly if if I'm going to point     
55:47     
to one main questions that do we have in of data that uh has been uh somehow     
55:55     
recorded the movement of of aons in different states and so uh and also     
56:03     
recorded the electrophysiological uh maybe characteristics of of those movements     
56:10     
something that has been done in in this work by uh actually the data is another     
56:16     
work but but the model has been uh produced based on the data that that uh     
56:23     
says how that actually shows how the recorded uh uh movement of a seagon     
56:30     
could be matched to to the electrophysical data like this this one     
56:37     
yeah but this is for an adult yeah this is for adults do we have any similar data for     
56:46     
uh other developmental is have you ever seen because I couldn't find these one     
56:52     
or two days I've been searching for but have you ever seen any similar data for     
56:58     
other development for example in day five in day 10 in day 15 and and lastly     
57:06     
in day 20 for example if we could consider four developmental States and     
57:11     
different movement and maybe different ones but is there any similar have you     
57:17     
seen any similar work that have been those movements in different states and also they     
57:25     
beside that the more important one is the     
57:31     
electrophysiological characterization of those action potentials movements and     
57:37     
especially iron currents yeah uh now I know that there're like I'm not sure about like     
57:44     
the larvel stages so you know the thing that I guess you'd be looking for would     
57:49     
be like people recording neurons and laral worms from L1 to L4 and then like     
57:55     
looking for differences now I haven't seen anything like that I don't it pro it may exist I don't know but uh one of     
58:02     
the interesting things is like there's this stage called the daer stage which starts at L2 and it goes to L4 so it's     
58:09     
like this alternative sort of diap pausal state and in that stage you get a     
58:15     
lot of like uh you know sort of this quiescent Behavior so everything is     
58:20     
slowed down the metabolism slowed down and I I would looked Maybe and I'll look     
58:25     
for this there may be people who've done this in da stage where they can look at like the neuron neuronal activity and I     
58:33     
bet you that would probably show some pretty interesting differences but across like from L1 to L4 I'm not really     
58:40     
sure and it may show some differences uh but I don't know if people have done     
58:45     
that um so okay so uh uh going back to the     
58:52     
main question I I was asking these question because I was more interested the the artificial inter net der from     
59:00     
these actually models so if we could have some uh it is some it is something     
59:08     
not natural but maybe natural developmental process that the learning     
59:15     
of something new is going to be happening something that has been coded in in the seans and it's going to be     
59:22     
raled uh after some developmental processes so I'm going we are going by     
59:28     
by this one we need to main understand what new type of artificial n networks     
59:34     
could be derived from these developmental States uh maybe stage by     
59:40     
stage and and then uh using and then by fitting those new parameters to a model     
59:46     
like this we could understand maybe a new type of uh new type of learning     
59:53     
system that is is happening the from a Locomotion point     
59:59     
of view right and that could be again uh extended to other type of     
1:00:07     
behaviors yeah well I I mean I know that people probably haven't done that um in     
1:00:12     
terms of I know people are starting to go in the direction of like building artificial neural networks that conform     
1:00:19     
to C like they they talk about how it's anatomically sort of ground     
1:00:25     
and they you know they'll do things like have different layers representing different parts of the brain anatomy or     
1:00:31     
something it's very general in terms of the uh metaphor but I've not seen anyone     
1:00:36     
do anything developmental like that uh generally speaking now you bring up a     
1:00:41     
good question which is you know to be able to say take a artificial neural network and maybe like evolve it in     
1:00:48     
stages or have different stages of its development so that means is that you     
1:00:54     
would have like neurons in the neural network that would maybe like be born     
1:00:59     
and have certain properties and then over time those properties would change     
1:01:04     
and you'd end up with a a mature state of the neuron and that would just you know that would affect the information     
1:01:11     
processing and there'd be a lot of interactions there which you know would be in you know we could we could you     
1:01:17     
know play around with some toy models maybe to start which would be like very small Neal networks and then figure out     
1:01:24     
like if we have neurons and this would be maybe you know after we look at the data     
1:01:29     
and see kind of we'd have to kind of Define the stages first and then you'd have your artificial neural you know I'd     
1:01:35     
have a toy model which would be a very small Network and then you'd say okay now how do we want to implement these     
1:01:41     
neurons how would they you know may might they be able to do some standard computational operations like logic     
1:01:49     
gates or something like that and if they can do that then what is the maybe the advantage of having having those     
1:01:54     
developmental stages in there you know what would be if you switch on like a     
1:02:00     
neuron or change its developmental State what is it doing in there and why is it     
1:02:06     
doing it and what's the advantage of that um you can just simply model development recapitulate development in     
1:02:12     
the neural network but with a neural network people tend to ask like why do I want to do this so it's kind of     
1:02:19     
pointless otherwise yeah that's that's an old question we are not going to actually     
1:02:25     
maybe derive a new AR Network that could be uh could work better than what we     
1:02:31     
have right now because for sure what have been done so     
1:02:37     
far in Aral networks is based on some much more complex uh creationss like     
1:02:45     
maybe humankind and they that is uh billions of time more complex than the     
1:02:52     
seon but uh but but the main question that we are going to maybe uh     
1:02:58     
uh in such a paper we're going to ask is uh is to understand how that's maybe     
1:03:07     
uh learning process in a c is actually happening and uh and some questions like     
1:03:16     
like that but from uh it's for me and maybe for others much more     
1:03:22     
from uh I'm I'm trying to uh based on another word I'm trying to design some     
1:03:30     
mathematical models for these developmental process so that it could show how a simple model of maybe a     
1:03:38     
circuit with just maybe uh five or six here we     
1:03:43     
have in our circuit we have uh three compartments maybe uh from some simpler     
1:03:51     
one to a more complex one in a c uh it could really greatly show how a     
1:03:58     
mathematical model and then engineering point of view could uh be derive from     
1:04:03     
such a simp yeah yeah I think that's you know     
1:04:11     
um all interesting stuff um I have you to send you another paper that we'     
1:04:17     
working on this is in a different group uh where we've been looking at these     
1:04:22     
like I guess they're called like epigenetic functions or something I'll have to dig it out but like basically     
1:04:29     
where you turn things on at different stages it's like a computational function that like you know this is     
1:04:36     
something that people have explored in the artificial life literature but it basically is a     
1:04:42     
developmental um you know it sets a developmental set of stages for artificial neurons and other things like     
1:04:48     
that so I'll have to yeah it's related to that Jesse so yeah I'll send you that paper and I'll send you more detail I     
1:04:55     
can't remember the exact details right now but um yeah that's a that's an     
1:05:01     
interesting area I think there's a lot of work that could be done in it so um     
1:05:06     
let's yeah let's keep thinking about it please send me a copy or you know a link to this document for sure actually I was     
1:05:13     
going to uh a little more pufy document and then share     
1:05:19     
anyone I will do this day okay yeah that's great I may today I     
1:05:29     
need a little exertion the thing     
1:05:35     
it yeah all right it sounds great uh we did     
1:05:42     
have some other things in the chat um like some side conversations in the chat     
1:05:47     
about uh Dick's talk and then some of the other things so uh we had a question by Pocky who had     
1:05:54     
to leave uh so I had a question my network is unstable uh for the breast cancer     
1:06:01     
problem are we using a machine deep learning to get a better version of inpainting algorithm yeah so that's what     
1:06:08     
dick was saying is that we don't have a good machine learning solution and and     
1:06:13     
machine learning could help deep learning could help but you'd need of course training data and then you need to have you know     
1:06:20     
basically what we're we be trying to do there is find features in noise or you know extrapolate     
1:06:28     
features from like a very sparse data set so that that would be the way that     
1:06:33     
you would do that then you'd have to apply the algorithm uh Susan says a better version     
1:06:39     
of in painting needs to be developed yeah we talked about that perhaps a machine learning version would work     
1:06:45     
better yeah I think for I was looking at like how they were generating the lines and there were these random sort of line     
1:06:53     
strategies and there different ways you could generate the distributional lines I mean there different distributions you     
1:06:59     
could use and kind of reminds me of Pickup Sticks I don't know if you played that when you were a kid where you have     
1:07:06     
a bunch of sticks you throw them down and they form these patterns and you pull them apart I mean they form     
1:07:11     
different patterns they're kind of random but you know you can generate different like patterns of lines you can     
1:07:18     
generate like you know like generate from one side then another side you know     
1:07:23     
and and and do it that way and you know that might give a little bit more     
1:07:29     
information but yeah that there are a lot of strategies one can use algorithmically to do     
1:07:35     
that uh then dick says Pocky responding to Pocky there are CT algorithms that     
1:07:41     
use machine learning and others that are for in painting my talk today was on precursor reconstructing a picture from     
1:07:48     
lines of a pixel extracted from it so yeah that was what we were talking about and and then uh yeah so there     
1:07:56     
there was another oh this was a zoom link and then Jesse said this is a different conversation this is the     
1:08:02     
second conversation with Ved the topic of stage differentiation is     
1:08:09     
interesting that's great uh and then yeah so yeah this is thanks for all     
1:08:15     
those comments um yeah so let's follow up on that stuff I know dick has been     
1:08:21     
working on this for quite a while so it would be interesting to see people kind of take on some of these     
1:08:27     
projects and um you know that I know that Nick wants to publish some of this work in in different gues under     
1:08:34     
different guises so that's that's an opportunity to get     
1:08:41     
published um artificial life is that another method of modeling cells and     
1:08:50     
their interactions uh well it's a field where people basically Bally tried to simulate life so you know in the field     
1:08:57     
they do a lot of things with simulating cells simulating genomes simulating     
1:09:02     
Evolution a lot of and even some people doing things outside of like computers in terms of like working with Proto     
1:09:10     
cells and things like that um yeah there's the aif conference link so that     
1:09:15     
you know they have a lot of different things but there's been this sort of imperative to sort of simulate life and     
1:09:21     
people have focused on largely on either like you know biologically inspired     
1:09:27     
models or like genetic algorithms or things like that and from that you get these Innovations not a lot of people     
1:09:34     
have done things with development so there have been different you know people have been trying to develop different tools to work on     
1:09:42     
development um but yeah oh I think the term I was thinking of was a     
1:09:47     
canalization function so this is from uh waddington's work on Canal uh canalization of     
1:09:54     
development so they have these canalization functions which are where you kind of take a certain trajectory     
1:10:02     
and then halfway through the trajectory you switch to a different trajectory and you keep switching down until you get to     
1:10:07     
an adult form so the idea would be that you would have one set of like rules for     
1:10:13     
your neuron artificial neuron you'd switch to a different set of rules and     
1:10:18     
then you keep doing that until you get to the adult form and the idea would be to recapitulate what's happening in     
1:10:24     
development where you have different cell types that change you go from a precursor cell to another type of cell     
1:10:32     
to an adult form so there are different things happening in development that correspond to sort of the development of     
1:10:38     
that cell and you know you could then you could just say like that could be     
1:10:44     
something like a set of logic functions or a set of ion channels that's expressed to give a certain output so     
1:10:50     
that's that's what that would be and so so it's again it's a computer it's in a computer we're not trying to take every     
1:10:58     
part of development and model it we're just trying to model the most important parts for getting a sort of a     
1:11:05     
computational output     
1:11:14     
so okay well thank you for attending the meeting everyone it was very interesting     
1:11:21     
a lot of good things going on     
1:11:27     
any other comments or questions before we     
1:11:36     
go no and I just I'm asking about the artificial life because I wonder if I     
1:11:43     
should include it in methods of modeling cells     
1:11:48     
oh um people have used it for that so yeah there might be some good references     
1:11:53     
say if if uh I don't I don't know there are a lot of proceedings conference proceedings there's an artificial life     
1:12:00     
journal so there might be some interesting articles there well I'm just going to put a oneliner in there saying     
1:12:06     
this is another type of model yeah and if they want me to expand on any of my sentences in my 40 page write up I can     
1:12:14     
do that     
1:12:21     
yeah all right way down yeah     
1:12:28     
okay also I've been talking about some part of maybe some point that is more uh     
1:12:37     
related to to the thermodynamics and energetic point of view of of of these     
1:12:42     
uh developmental processes so maybe if Susan has some uh point on that uh I     
1:12:50     
would be glad to share with uh I I've been trying to contact you in the past     
1:12:56     
because you've been talking about some biophysics uh biophysical maybe uh Pro     
1:13:04     
uh uh perspective of the words but couldn't find your can you my email now     
1:13:13     
yeah okay sure that works do email contact     
1:13:19     
yeah and of course Dr G and if you could help uh because I know you have been     
1:13:26     
doing some great work in the past I've some of your work have to     
1:13:34     
cab okay uh just just write me and let me know what you want for sure thank you     
1:13:42     
okay thank you thanks everyone all right all right so now I'd like to talk a     
1:13:47     
little bit about different developmental stages and simulating things in an artificial Neal Network     
1:13:54     
and then some of the canalization functions and what those look like so     
1:13:59     
you know we talked about development we talked about having say like a precursor cell celegans what you'll typically have     
1:14:06     
as a what they call a developmental cell that developmental cell will have a nomenclature of the lineage tree so that     
1:14:14     
could be like Abal for example these cells will become they keep dividing and     
1:14:20     
they form adult cells down the line it could be adult neurons it could be adult     
1:14:26     
epithelial cells it could be a number of things and so we know what the fate of any one of these precursor cells are     
1:14:33     
before they in seans before they become an adult cell so you have these different cell     
1:14:41     
types the oo muscle and their different lineages     
1:14:50     
actually muscle does not come from the ab sub or from the lineage but anyways you have a number of different cell     
1:14:56     
types that you can have coming out of a number of precursor cells so one of the     
1:15:02     
things we were talking about is U ION channel expression so in these precursor     
1:15:08     
cells you have some ION channel expression and you have some electrical activity although it's not as uh defined     
1:15:14     
as the in the adult cells so like in neurons you have specific ion channels that are expressed for different types     
1:15:20     
of neurons and epithelial cells and muscle cells you also have other ion channels that are expressed they're very     
1:15:27     
distinct to the cellone but in the precursor cells we can't say that those     
1:15:32     
ion channels are being expressed so you might have a subset of those ion channels expressed you might have     
1:15:38     
different ion channels expressed I don't think anyone has characterized this in a     
1:15:43     
data set uh but we can do simulations where we presuppose that the precursor     
1:15:49     
cells will have different ion CH a sub maybe a sub set of ion channels and then more ion channels get expressed as the     
1:15:58     
lineage uh develops and you get terminally differentiated cells     
1:16:03     
so you know this is a set of experiments that we could do because there's a whole     
1:16:08     
literat term bio electricity sort of what happens if you have developmental     
1:16:14     
cells that have the subset of ion channels what are the electrical signals look like and you know maybe what     
1:16:21     
happens when different neurons are connected so what happens there is you get these uh developmental cells that     
1:16:29     
start to to differentiate into terminally differentiated cells and in doing so they start to form     
1:16:35     
a neural network so they start to connect by axonal connections or     
1:16:41     
sometimes there are Gap Junctions that make shorter electrical connections between the cells and so in the case of     
1:16:49     
our ion channels you know those Drive ION channel expressions so when a terminally differentiated neuron uh     
1:16:56     
synapses with another terminally differentiated neuron or they make these electrical connections that triggers ION     
1:17:03     
channel expression that then uh can change the function of the cell more     
1:17:09     
completely so you get this I guess electrophysiological     
1:17:15     
phenotype that defines developmental cells that defines these terminally differentiate neurons and then defines     
1:17:22     
the connected once the neurons fully connected so there are these different stages of sort of maturity to this     
1:17:29     
emerging neural network we have sort of this first phase which is the developmental phase we could call it or     
1:17:35     
the embryonic phase and this is where you have your     
1:17:41     
lineage tree and those lineage trees or those developmental cells in the lineage tree     
1:17:48     
will Express like a subset of neurons where they or a subset of ions     
1:17:53     
channels or they could express different ion channels Al together because uh developmental cells like stem     
1:18:01     
cells in in mammals have ION channel you know they don't make action potentials     
1:18:07     
but they have electrical activity that affects the physiology of the cell and maybe neighboring     
1:18:12     
themselves so we have this development embryonic stage where we might have this     
1:18:17     
sort of maybe mature stage where the cells are mature     
1:18:23     
uh but the network is not so then we have this third stage which is the     
1:18:29     
mature Network and that's where you get this     
1:18:36     
modification ION channel expression through not through the maturation of the cells but maturation of the network     
1:18:43     
connections so those are our three stages and so you know we can model it that way and we can elect our     
1:18:49     
physiological properties for each of these okay now let's talk about let's talk about canalization     
1:18:56     
functions so this is something that we've explored in the context of embodied     
1:19:02     
agents and some of the work we've done on developmental neuros simulation so these are canalization     
1:19:09     
function so canalization functions are based on waddington's work on canalization uh cell canalization     
1:19:16     
development or canalization networks so what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw an EP genc     
1:19:24     
landscape and this is from watton's work so you know this is something that people have developed quantitative     
1:19:30     
models for wadington was there only thinking one metaphor so you start at the top of the     
1:19:35     
landscape with usually use as a ball to show the trajectory and there are these what they     
1:19:41     
call channels or C canals and so canalization is where the ball will     
1:19:47     
follow a certain path through this landscape so often times you'll have     
1:19:53     
these branching points that Define different paths through the landscape so you'll have like these     
1:20:00     
different paths to a mature phenotype and again this is a conceptual     
1:20:05     
view although people put numbers on this and quantitative values on this and so this is what the landscape looks like it     
1:20:11     
looks like a tree and it's just these channels to this landscape so it cuts through the landscape that finds a     
1:20:17     
minimum or a Minima path near the landscape so this ball will roll down this path until it reaches this branch     
1:20:26     
and this Branch point is important because it acts to switch the ball from one Canal to another so depending on if     
1:20:33     
you have two different species or if you have two embryos under certain environmental conditions you can either     
1:20:40     
go down one Canal or another canal and so this is you you know you might think of this as like the path of least     
1:20:47     
resistance but the important part is that there's a switch at this branching point     
1:20:53     
that will determine which path this ball goes down but notice when you go down One path versus another you go to a     
1:21:00     
different part of the landscape so if we think of this bottom layer here as the phenotypic space     
1:21:08     
you're in one part of the phenotypic Space versus another it is a very general model so it     
1:21:13     
could be it could be a trait wise sort of landscape or could be a whole embryo sort of landscape but the point is is     
1:21:20     
that you take different trajectories given a single decision point and so you know if the decision point is further up     
1:21:27     
in the tree then it it results in a more radical shift in the phenotype if it's     
1:21:33     
down further here like if you you know make a you have a decision Point here     
1:21:38     
and you move this way and you keep moving this way until you get here and then there's a shift down this way this     
1:21:44     
results in a a lesser change in the phenotype so for example let's say we     
1:21:50     
have a an embryo and for that species the canalization     
1:21:57     
function tells the embryo to sort of take a left take another left and then     
1:22:02     
take a right instead of a left and so you know the whale type might be here so     
1:22:09     
it requires three branching points and sort of gives a direction along that     
1:22:14     
landscape but then there's some mutant phenotype which is here and that might     
1:22:20     
be the instructions might be take a left take a left and take another left so the mutant phenotype is here and the wild     
1:22:26     
type is here and you can see there's a difference in there in terms of where they're they occupy phenotype space     
1:22:32     
through this single switch that pushes the phenotype away from that wild type     
1:22:39     
to this mutant state but it follows this alternate pathway this alternate con so     
1:22:44     
canalization functions are based on this modogo it's basically a function that allows sort of an artificial genotype to     
1:22:51     
be regulated in such a way way so that it changes the trajectory of gene     
1:22:56     
expression or the expression of the trait to go on an alternate P we can think about the phenotype as an     
1:23:02     
artificial chromosome where the properties of the phenotype are encoded in     
1:23:08     
this encoding here so this is a a gene and it's composed of zeros and ones     
1:23:16     
which encode a trait so say I wanted to have a striping     
1:23:21     
pattern wanted to generate a striping pattern from this binary     
1:23:27     
string I might have a volume here then these zeros and ones represent     
1:23:33     
Parts where I have sort of a clear surface and a shaded surface     
1:23:39     
so the ones are shaded the zeros are clear so I have a zero compartment one compartment a zero compartment a zero     
1:23:46     
compartment another one compartment so I have a shaded area here zero one zero so     
1:23:53     
this actually gives me a stripe pattern with three stripes and so this is I can actually     
1:23:59     
form a pattern from this information in the gene but now see I want to change the     
1:24:05     
sort of the patterning structure so I'll have regulatory elements up stream of     
1:24:11     
this encoding and this genotype artificial genotype is encoding the     
1:24:18     
phenotype so this string is encoding a phenotype     
1:24:27     
so this string is encoding a phenotype here now these regulatory     
1:24:32     
elements can serve as the switches so this might be switch well we'll give the     
1:24:38     
switch different states so we'll say that this switch is zero this switch is one this switch is     
1:24:44     
zero so each of these states can act to change the point at which we or maybe     
1:24:51     
the states at which we're interpreting this striping pattern so say for example     
1:24:56     
of this regulatory switch was Zero then it would give me this if this regulatory     
1:25:04     
switch were one it would invert these values so that I would have a very different phenotype in fact I would just     
1:25:11     
be able to switch the shaded areas with the clear areas in this example to get     
1:25:16     
the output of a one in that position the second regulatory state is     
1:25:22     
a one and so that might be like if this were zero it would write this out and if     
1:25:28     
this were one it might not write this out so we would have no information and     
1:25:34     
we would have no striping the third regulatory element might take the values     
1:25:40     
and transpose them so you might end up with this these four elements being read     
1:25:45     
last after these elements so you can see there are a number of things you can do with these regulatory elements Visa this     
1:25:51     
information in the gene or in the artificial genotype if we think about this in terms     
1:25:57     
of canalization function this translates into switches so we might have like a     
1:26:03     
switching situation where we could use all three of these regulatory elements in     
1:26:09     
Tandem and come up with an answer so let's say for example we had our zero     
1:26:15     
and one so our zero and one means that you know we can either write well I'm     
1:26:22     
trying to remember so we can use these in tandem     
1:26:28     
so we can say that uh if it's a state of zero it goes in this     
1:26:34     
direction if it's a state of one it goes in this direction then if again if we have a     
1:26:40     
zero here a one here a zero here a one here and we can just keep going down     
1:26:47     
like this but the point is is that this tree represents different sort of states     
1:26:52     
of this regulatory system at different intervals so we'd start with the left     
1:26:58     
we'd say this is a z or one this is a z R1 this is a z R1 so let's say we had a     
1:27:03     
regulatory state of 0 one0 we would go Z one and then Zer and     
1:27:09     
that would be our pH part of our Pho typic space if we didn't have it and as I said you know we have the consequences     
1:27:16     
of this structure would be that uh one you know a zero would mean that we would write     
1:27:22     
this information out a one would be that this is the right patterning so it's not inverted it's     
1:27:29     
this pattern and then a zero means that it's spreading in this order and so this is the part of the     
1:27:36     
sort of the phenotypic space of this landscape where this pattern would inhabit if we changed our regulatory     
1:27:43     
elements we could we could transpose this pattern end up with end up with an alternate phenotype where we're reading     
1:27:50     
one one0 0 one 0 0 which would change this     
1:27:55     
patterning structure or you know we could have a state where one of these     
1:28:01     
regulatory elements would switch their state and we would end up with no pattern at all and so those all those     
1:28:07     
things occupy this phenotypic space and so this canalization function is is     
1:28:13     
basically a set of switches that enable these binary uh States in this genotypic     
1:28:20     
encoding to be read in different ways and produce different forms of patterning so it's a form of sort of     
1:28:25     
digital morphogenesis that isn't you know based on Turing morphogenesis or anything like     
1:28:30     
that but instead is based on these binary decisions that get made in the switch and so this is a computational     
1:28:37     
structure that allows you to explore different parts of the phenotypic space     
1:28:43     
another way to think about this too is by using instead of zeros and ones using     
1:28:48     
logic functions in these regulatory elements so you might have an and or or     
1:28:54     
a nor and that might translate into like doing things with this genotypic     
1:29:00     
encoding that you know you have two genotypic encoding so you have an alternate     
1:29:06     
encoding where you do like mathematical operations on you know bitwise     
1:29:12     
mathematical operations so you might take like this one where you say what's the state of     
1:29:18     
both of these if they're both zero then it's a zero otherwise it's a one output you might say like a you know a     
1:29:26     
nor out a nor uh operation conducted on this set of binary     
1:29:33     
States X or operating on these set of binary States and so forth and you can Define these all up in this regulatory     
1:29:40     
region which give the instructions for interpreting this this uh genotypic     
1:29:46     
encoding and turning it into a phenotypic encoding and then we can translate that into a decision tree     
1:29:53     
which constitutes our uh canalization function and so we've explored     
1:29:58     
canalization functions like I said some of the work we've done on uh developmental neuros simulation in the     
1:30:04     
orthogonal lab and so please check those out for more information
