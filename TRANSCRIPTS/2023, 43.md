## TRANSCRIPT     
0:21     
okay did you get a chance to look at any of the emails I sent yesterday yeah I was looking at some of them uh you're     
0:27     
talking about some of well first part you're talking about some of the ideas that you had for uh like different open     
0:33     
questions and yeah and and then I came across this paper on     
0:39     
trees yeah yeah it seems to me they've rediscovered the differentiation tree     
0:45     
but I'm not absolutely sure but I got a reply from one of the authors uh I think     
0:50     
I sent it to you this morning yeah oh yeah I saw that email so the the paper     
0:56     
is a reference tree a reference cell tree will serve science better than a reference so     
1:01     
at yeah so I you know I just put it as a question is his reference tree the same thing as a differentiation tree or I     
1:08     
think it's vager is that yeah now I did I looked up the followup     
1:16     
papers there are only three papers that have referred to that paper and none of them seem to get into     
1:23     
trees oh yeah this was from 2023 I don't know what what was the date     
1:30     
on his paper I forgot uh it says 2023 oh it might be yeah so but yeah     
1:36     
they don't seem to they say tree based nomenclature which doesn't mean     
1:42     
tree yeah yeah but we're trying to hang things on a tree too     
1:50     
right anyway uh uh read the paper and see what you think about similarities     
1:57     
and differences okay okay uh I think it might be something we should refer to     
2:04     
but uh and uh I I put a note there that     
2:09     
maybe we can get him into Exel yeah now what we need actually is an     
2:17     
axel that's transparent okay yeah so you can uh follow the cells yeah     
2:27     
yeah right I     
2:33     
hello hello hello how are you all right     
2:42     
tired okay so anyway good to meet     
2:47     
you but he you you just starting a project or what uh I'm talking     
2:54     
[Music] to for while in the past again I'm     
3:00     
rejoining whole project the open project again I mainly chns but now days I'm     
3:08     
trying to find some inter between my PR works and what's going     
3:14     
on at the War I hope to be useful uh     
3:20     
actually I'm having some uh I devoted some enough these days for the whole     
3:26     
project so find like yeah yeah he's been doing a lot of stuff     
3:33     
with like Channel worm and openworm like openworm has a number of projects and they're doing things with ion channels     
3:40     
and he's done a lot of really good work with that so okay so you got him pretty busy Yeah well yeah I mean well he's     
3:46     
work yeah he's doing that but like we we talked before about like doing things in development too so     
3:54     
okay okay because I'm also looking for somebody who wants to work on a new form of computer     
4:03     
tomography okay which is very different from Diva     
4:10     
world this is this is aimed at uh detecting small     
4:16     
tumors right at at low dose low xray     
4:22     
dose okay so you know somebody who might be interested let me     
4:28     
know I've got I've got a kid working with me     
4:35     
on the project right now uh he's just out of high school and uh he starts college in     
4:43     
January so starting January I won't see him     
4:49     
again he he's doing very very     
4:54     
well uh Chinese kid who lives nearby     
5:01     
yeah so yeah that so I saw that that paper and then yeah you sent some other     
5:08     
papers alongside that uh yeah it looks like I I don't     
5:15     
know if I sent you the grantsmanship paper like maybe uh which one was that the Quake paper or the I called one uh     
5:23     
by Quake yeah Quake okay yeah that one yeah I see it yeah yeah this is a guy     
5:29     
who's very proud of having raised $600 million for for yeah for a soell atlas     
5:37     
yeah they're trying to make this project as big as the human genetic project     
5:42     
yeah this is the which one is this uh yeah I think that's in quick yeah quick     
5:48     
that's this is mostly about how how good he is at raising money right they yeah     
5:54     
they kind of go through their project and uh go through the right I I     
6:00     
think the trees thing is a good antidote to this paper yeah says okay where you     
6:06     
going to hang all this data right and the problem is these people     
6:12     
need lineage trees and from our point of view they need differentiation     
6:18     
trees okay and uh getting a lineage tree from a mouse brain is pretty hard it's     
6:25     
opaque great great okay yeah you might be able to do     
6:31     
it with a fish like a zebra fish you know something that's bit bit more transparent right     
6:40     
right but uh I don't know I I think the these people are gonna H they're     
6:45     
knocking themselves they're trying to make a big deal about making a list of how many cells there are great and uh I     
6:52     
don't know if I sent you what I wrote about it the number of cells they find is about the same as what people knew 20     
7:00     
years ago right but didn't make such a fuss about     
7:08     
it okay and uh the uh the uh popular article I sent you ignores that work and     
7:16     
goes back another 20 years to stuff that's wrong or at least     
7:23     
inici which one is that this one or the T no the uh it's the uh     
7:30     
Oh shoot what do you call it it was a popular article oh wait wait go go back to your list oh go back to your list     
7:38     
it's     
7:46     
uh no it's not there let me get to the reference I'll put in the chat     
7:58     
okay     
8:25     
[Music] oh     
8:42     
oh boy try little tactic     
8:58     
here ah here     
9:10     
is it's from Quantum magazine oh okay okay uh by     
9:19     
sappu Sapp kagu all right and it was published this month yes that's it yeah     
9:27     
now see this one makes mentions cell counts for mammals as low     
9:33     
as 500 okay yeah that goes back to the     
9:39     
80s the the work uh that showed about 7,000 cells in my cell cell types of M     
9:48     
goes back to I think 1998 okay okay and now they've     
9:53     
rediscovered about the same amount they don't give these guys any credit     
10:02     
that's the problem with being 80 years old you know too much     
10:12     
yeah oh this yeah this was uh Stephen Quake they cite Stephen quake in here     
10:18     
and uh yeah that's got the Quake yeah this one is good for getting some some key references but when you get into it     
10:25     
you can see there's probably thousands of papers right right     
10:30     
okay so all these people are struggling with their cell atlases which have no     
10:35     
coordinates right they have no they have they they don't know where the cells are     
10:42     
they don't know the lineage and they're trying desperately to figure that out because they know they need that right     
10:49     
okay and uh the the trees and some other articles make that very clear it took me     
10:55     
a while to figure out that Atlas does not mean Atlas yeah     
11:00     
I mean that list is supposed to be a map right not not just a     
11:06     
list yeah a lot of the stuff they have is like they well sometimes they'll put images up and they'll have like a stack     
11:13     
of images and you know but they won't have any other information it's just kind of like that's why I got into it I     
11:19     
was trying to make sense of what's an what's a cell Atlas right what is it or a brain atas what is it and it     
11:27     
isn't it is an atlas but they call it that to get money     
11:37     
right okay so I think we will end up joining chorus of those to say hold on     
11:43     
you're gonna have to get do your work and get your cell lineages and get real ones yeah I sent     
11:49     
you one article on a strange method which labels a whole bunch of beads and then     
11:56     
it takes an epithelial to with the DNA and each one has a different DNA on it     
12:02     
then they put an epithelial tissue on top of these beads and this gets into the cells     
12:09     
somehow and then they map that well it only works for epithelia     
12:15     
and I doubt it works well yeah I don't know if I got that of     
12:22     
course it's very destructive so I doubt they're getting lineages right right I don't know if     
12:30     
it's toed as the best method for getting the cell lineage yeah there it is slide TS slide tags this yeah single nucleus     
12:38     
barcoding for multimodal spatial genomics yeah this is     
12:46     
garbage it's sort of how to look at an embryo through frosted glass     
12:56     
yeah huh yeah I don't know um okay so any rate I you know I thought     
13:03     
they had something but it's clear that all they have is     
13:10     
money yeah so yeah I mean it it's interesting because there's been a lot of work done on uh like cell tracking as     
13:18     
we've seen in the meetings and then there's been all this work on atlases but people haven't necessarily brought     
13:24     
them together uh yeah I think the the problem is they use animals that are opaque and     
13:32     
have tiny cells and uh you know the Axel was at     
13:39     
least had big cells if the it's still op     
13:44     
uh uh some of the fish I think might provide     
13:50     
transparency yeah I don't maybe that's a place to search there we can like in what in like     
13:59     
uh like zebra fish or in well zebra fish is the most popular fish there's no     
14:04     
question of that no maybe V can look up cell sizes     
14:12     
in fish and find a fish with big     
14:18     
cells and then we see if it's transparent some of them have lots of pigment some don't have pigments so     
14:24     
later I used to follow a WKA probably 40 years ago     
14:30     
called the literature on marble fish okay yeah they're kind of     
14:36     
interesting uh but they're usually quite transparent at early stages oh     
14:44     
okay okay uh so uh that that's a possibility     
14:51     
uh I I think what we need is a model organism for so we need EXT tracking in     
14:57     
vertebrates yeah now we got it already in nematodes     
15:04     
not can we get one in in     
15:10     
vertebras Lara Lara fish might be the best bit if any of them have especially if we     
15:16     
can get it uh one way to get large cells by the way is     
15:22     
polyol yeah it works for Axel Axel Lott I think have been done up to seven poyy     
15:29     
and uh you get two effects from this the animal size is the same the cells are     
15:35     
much bigger and they're stupid yeah because they don't have as many cells in     
15:41     
their brain right     
15:47     
okay so if that can be that was done in the 30s in axelon almost a hundred years ago uh so     
15:55     
if you could do that for a transparent fish you might be able to create a     
16:00     
polyploid in which you could do lineage     
16:06     
tracking okay yeah so uh I don't know are you game for that my     
16:14     
H see if you can find any literature on cell sizes and     
16:20     
fish actually I'm uh as I said I'm not yet bu into the UN of something that uh     
16:29     
it's been happening right now in the devil in Devil form but we have done and     
16:35     
I I know students over here that are working on the mechanical aspects of uh     
16:41     
the movement of fish so if there could be any uh     
16:47     
maybe yeah for for the somehow for simulation of the movement if there     
16:54     
could be any uh after uh of course we have done some work work on the lineage     
16:59     
part and we could somehow uh step by step go from the     
17:06     
small size fish to when it become it grows up we might be able to yeah from     
17:13     
my side I could maybe do something for for the well you don't you don't need to you     
17:19     
don't need a big fish laral fish for sure yeah laral fish are small enough I     
17:28     
I wrote a paper once on putting laral uh act uh zebra fish in a capillary     
17:37     
tube and this would allow one to see the fish you could rotate the tube and see     
17:42     
the fish at any angle okay so and then you could do     
17:48     
computer tomography and do 3D structure so it's not out of the question uh I think the trick is to find     
17:57     
there many many species of fish let's see uh look that up     
18:03     
actually uh     
18:09     
yes number I'll look it up number     
18:15     
of fish     
18:25     
PES how many speaks ah 33,000     
18:32     
known okay 33,000 known species of     
18:37     
fish so amongst those there might be one with big     
18:48     
cells so you sent me I think few more papers uh oh yeah I I read them and then     
18:55     
I send them to you but uh it's uh yeah I've got I've got     
19:02     
about 80 90 P papers oh wow oh that was the list you sent me the reference list     
19:09     
yeah this is I think this is just uh just nine that you sent me but I don't     
19:15     
know yeah oh okay this is this is my uh bibliography and uh yeah it's uh this is     
19:23     
the list let's see so you can see more of     
19:30     
now the paperclip means I have a copy okay you see I have a lot of work to do     
19:37     
in getting copies yeah yeah okay uh but this is what I've got     
19:43     
so far by picking out review articles hot articles Etc yeah yeah     
19:53     
okay you know like like this one for instance single cell lineage tracing     
20:00     
yeah it's like I see cell Atlas I see cell tracking spatial like spatial omx Stu I     
20:08     
mean it's clear that this field they're hoping for a breakthrough but they they need to be able to track     
20:15     
cells yeah that's great um should be pretty interesting to see all the     
20:21     
references there uh yeah he had some other papers in the in the thing that you sent me uh     
20:28     
this one was cellular diversity and lineage trajectory this was from mus single cell transcriptomic so you had a     
20:35     
couple of things outlined here yeah yeah the I've been trying to     
20:41     
read well I started reading these papers carefully though I understood that an atlas is not an atlas     
20:51     
yeah some of them some of them hope to get a lineage tree someday     
20:57     
right and uh but nobody's nobody's doing it right     
21:03     
right yeah P this one yeah Patrick Tam I just I wrote to him last night haven't     
21:08     
had a reply yet yeah uh I don't know if you call I did that     
21:14     
work on salamander mural plate with Anton     
21:21     
Jacobson 70s or so anyway Patrick Tam was postto     
21:26     
with with Jacob so that's how I do it oh     
21:33     
okay so yeah this is these atlases allow the dissection allow not build of     
21:40     
Developmental cell inages and molecular changes during umio Genesis and then you advances in     
21:48     
computational techniques have enabled the inference or Developmental lineages and differentiating     
21:54     
cells even without explicitly introduced genetic markers URS meaning you can     
21:59     
identify them from like this different gene expression patterns or whatever and     
22:05     
then so then they talk about this and then they have this this passage here it     
22:10     
is evident that bulk transcriptome analysis only provide an average of genome activity so this is the average     
22:18     
you know so you would get like a bunch of some signature but that's only an average because they do not take the     
22:25     
heterogene of cell populations into account the average modality oh go ahead by the     
22:31     
way the field is in real dis Ray which they don't seem to recognize uh let me     
22:38     
show you what I mean by that all right this is I I wrote a little bit more last     
22:45     
night uh uh this probably should not be separate     
22:52     
Pap we're doing but at any rate here look at this let's see let me get this     
22:58     
screen share back up     
23:04     
yeah screen     
23:14     
[Music] sharing okay here look look at     
23:24     
this let us assume that the human brain is constructed using a simple bifurcating differentiation     
23:30     
treat the number of cell types is presently estimated as between 3300 and     
23:37     
5100 this this is where I added the historical Stu roughly consistent with     
23:43     
the 7,000 CP [Music]     
23:50     
that with a total of 86 billion CS now look at this now that's okay that's for     
23:58     
human yeah how many times bigger is the human brain than the mouse brain uh probably about maybe two or     
24:06     
threefold I I don't know depending on the structure yeah well here's a paper I     
24:13     
should in mice     
24:19     
mice okay I found the P one of those papers discuss device and they find 140     
24:25     
million cells in the brain of huh okay so then I I took the the human     
24:34     
data if you want to call data uh that's 17 million to 26 million cells on     
24:41     
average that's 3351 and with the 86 billion     
24:46     
estimate okay so they're between 17 million another Reet cell type the     
24:52     
average is somewhere between 17 and 26 million right but I took powers of two     
25:00     
for a very simple-minded differentiation truth okay yeah and you get two the so     
25:06     
these numbers fall between 2 to the 24th and 2 to the 25th which means the portion of the if     
25:14     
there's a differentiation tree for the brain it would have about 24 Branch     
25:21     
about 24 25 times yeah okay     
25:30     
nobody did calculations like this so so     
25:38     
far so this I guess should actually get the mass of mass of the human brain and     
25:44     
the mass of the m sprin and just take the ratio see if it's consistent Yeah well yeah the the     
25:51     
cell yeah the cell estimates aren't like they just kind of estimate from I guess tissue I don't know how they actually     
25:58     
make the estimates yeah I don't know that's a lot of cells to deal with but     
26:03     
they're tackling it so you know I I think there could be a breakthrough but the Breakthrough might be in F finding     
26:09     
the right animal right with big cells and transparent brain     
26:16     
yeah okay so I suspect such an animal may exist     
26:22     
yeah well the thing about like Mamon brains is that you have different structure     
26:28     
and they have different like you know so in mammals the neocortex has expanded     
26:34     
greatly in different lineages oh yeah some of the papers try to make estimates of those things but I mean my     
26:42     
point being is that you'd have a very different differentiation tree or so you'd have maybe like yeah I I'd suspect     
26:50     
though that the base of the tree would be similar yeah yeah it would be probably okay you so uh     
26:59     
it's an interesting problem and you know these people want to tackle it but I     
27:04     
don't think they're doing it right yeah but i' take this you take a small     
27:11     
portion of their 600 million yeah I don't     
27:18     
know Zucker it's money you got from Zuckerberg yeah uh and you Zuckerberg is     
27:25     
building a huge couple hundred million dollar bunker in     
27:31     
in Hawaii oh yeah yeah they have they've funded a lot     
27:36     
of the biomedical they have a huge uh fund for biomedical research the Chan     
27:42     
Zuckerberg whatever it is but yeah they they definitely favor sort of the omx     
27:49     
research I think in a lot of it okay but I don't know uh yeah I mean this is uh     
27:57     
again yeah I get the sense that the literature is fragmented for the field is in disarray it's just not doesn't     
28:03     
seem like they're connecting everything together the way that you would need     
28:09     
to no and then uh well I don't know this this tree paper seems to me as being     
28:15     
ignored yeah anyway I was surprised that the     
28:21     
uh one of the Au reply the the other one uh was probably a student     
28:28     
uh because the email bounced oh yeah uh I regarding the the fish you     
28:36     
were talking about uh yeah i' I've been searching in my somehow bookmarks uh and     
28:44     
I'm somehow interested as I said uh in the some topics like intersection     
28:50     
between uh what I've done and models like I is they related diseases like     
28:57     
channelopathies like uh parking Stone uh Etc and what we could do with models     
29:04     
like cgans or zebra fish uh I found a paper     
29:09     
Rel work that has been done using uh zebra fish as the tool but they have     
29:17     
somehow been looking for a gene which is uh some we could say common they have     
29:25     
some uh similar rules in but they could be useful     
29:31     
for for thinking how part could uh     
29:37     
actually be uh treated in child in children so they are working basically     
29:44     
and uh make from a lineage point of view     
29:49     
they are they have been wor on on this disease uh from a from uh we can say how     
29:58     
the genes in children uh are causing the parking Stone there some rare type of     
30:04     
parking Stone which is uh really uh in some actually some children can     
30:12     
have that type of parone as a child really and yeah and so if we if you are trying     
30:20     
to L into uh these kind of applications maybe uh I'm I'm saying from my point of     
30:27     
view it's it would be really interesting I could join you and work on some type of genes that are uh could be as a tool     
30:36     
could be studied in Sea elegant or other type of animals when they are uh at the     
30:42     
beginning of the their growth or their okay different different steps of life     
30:49     
and then actually we we could see how we can uh use that type of tool for     
30:55     
studying such diseases uh this is one example par example I     
31:00     
would like to if it could be posia join you I I     
31:08     
I once had a bird seemed to have Parkinson at a very early     
31:16     
stage when I was a kid but I thought Parkinson's was a disease mostly of old     
31:22     
people yeah this is true but it is a a rare type of songes     
31:27     
gen has some roots in genetics some type of children     
31:33     
could have that interesting okay due to some     
31:38     
mutations yeah and so as I said it could be studed some similar diseases could be     
31:45     
studied if we could look into this some similar gen in seant from the earlier     
31:51     
stage of seance and also as as we can see in zebra fish as well     
31:57     
uh if you have any similar uh issue or Topic in mind I would be really     
32:05     
interested is there any way you could use such genes for lineage     
32:12     
tracking may maybe okay okay because it     
32:18     
seems that lineage tracking in a ver ofate is very     
32:25     
difficult Brading you R has anyone succeeded you know um not really I mean     
32:32     
I've seen a couple papers I don't know if we did them in the group where they talk about Mouse uh they were trying to     
32:39     
reconstruct Mouse lineage trees but because you know the cells are not     
32:44     
deterministic in terms of their fate in other words like they're you know a product of signaling they tried to infer     
32:51     
the Lage trees instead or you know they tried to like compute what they should look like or     
32:58     
yeah so they tried to pick pairs yeah I wish I could find dig up that paper I can't quite remember the citation but     
33:05     
they would generate like a number of candidates so it was a little bit different approach they would generate     
33:10     
some candidates and then figure out which ones were most plausible and then yeah I think I think the essential thing     
33:17     
here is to have a transparent enough brain and a marker that could be tracked     
33:24     
you know in a lineage and uh and to have big enough cells so     
33:31     
it's makes it easier uh I don't know maybe     
33:38     
uh reian maybe yeah no they they have     
33:45     
because they have tadpoles which they're basically the first vertebrates     
33:52     
yeah okay but I don't know about cell sizing uh okay give me a second I'm     
33:58     
going to look up poly PL     
34:10     
uh look like Morgan joined us Morgan and     
34:17     
Lucas hi where are     
34:25     
you     
34:55     
okay     
35:00     
okay this one's more modest 39 papers I thought I've got or     
35:07     
polyl yeah I'm poly okay just poly or poly plus something     
35:14     
else well just po oh okay     
35:20     
okay and the question there any is there anything useful here I don't know is it mostly in plants or in like no no no     
35:28     
animals most be animals you can also do     
35:34     
ARA     
35:55     
okay     
36:25     
for     
36:40     
I think jitsy is slowing my computer down here     
36:55     
oh     
37:02     
so yeah just to finish up on this paper that we had uh they talked about the     
37:09     
averaging of BU bulk trans crypto and so you don't necessarily know     
37:15     
and this is one of the things about the paper we're we were doing that we're revising right now that you know we we     
37:22     
can get data from uh and CBI but you know those are     
37:28     
like averaged sort of trans crypto analyses or proteum analyses they you     
37:34     
know give you some insight into what's going on in a cell or in an organism but     
37:39     
they don't give you single cell resolution sometimes you can get single cell     
37:44     
resolution but it's hard to interpret that data in context so there are there     
37:50     
are a number of problems with like a lot of these sort of omix analyses and     
37:55     
plugging them into a tree in getting data so yeah this this has a     
38:00     
nice image of human development from the lastesis to the     
38:06     
fetus um just showing the complexity of development uh this is says uh they talk     
38:15     
about this paper pidan Salah at all 2019 uh they identified cell clusters     
38:22     
representing ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm lineages so these are the three germ     
38:27     
layers uh and then the number of cells in each cell cluster progressively increases and diverges into subclusters     
38:35     
as the embryo develops so that's what we're dealing with we have these three germ layers and we have things that are     
38:40     
diverging and and increasing in number but diverging into clusters so that's that's something that     
38:48     
you know we have to kind of think about we think about that in terms of a tree but they don't mention tree here really     
38:54     
just kind of like this is uh you know what's going on and then     
38:59     
they kind of give some more this is uh in other studies uh 38 to 98 cell     
39:06     
clusters are identified in the mouse cell Atlas at the organogenesis     
39:11     
stage uh although most cell types expand in numbers exponentially the abundance     
39:17     
of cells of different clusters may appear proportionally relative to one another so the different clusters sort     
39:24     
of stay in proportion and this is how you get different structures so you get larger structures smaller structures but     
39:31     
they kind of divide in their own sort of sublineage and again they don't use the word tree or lineage they just kind of     
39:37     
talk about clusters and precursors and things like that so that's it's interesting how that that language even     
39:44     
is disconnected uh when they talk about these     
39:55     
things okay the uh bibl the paper on polyes on     
40:02     
its way okay that's good any really good ones stand out or     
40:09     
well I didn't get to read it I just sent     
40:15     
it all right take I'll take a look later um     
40:20     
okay okay but yeah I think the polyploids are are key to cellage     
40:28     
okay yeah uh let's see some of those     
40:55     
papers so let's see oh there is this other     
41:01     
article that you sent me I don't know what this was is this like a letter you sent this uh the brain cell Atlas     
41:09     
lineage trees and differentiation trees oh yeah yeah it's one one yeah one I     
41:15     
read last night oh okay and this is the one that yeah so     
41:20     
this is uh the list I sent you goes back to 1849     
41:27     
oh wow okay okay and poly plates all     
41:34     
right all right the way you make by the way the way you make a polyploid is you     
41:39     
let the eggs start dividing and you I think they heat it up or something like     
41:45     
that and it prevents division of the cell while the nucleus     
41:52     
divides okay so you end up with a poly yeah just kind of buch up in the same     
41:58     
cell yeah yeah so it it's an old technique but it     
42:06     
worked yeah wonder if they have newer techniques for     
42:11     
that I don't know I I don't think there's any interest in that work     
42:22     
oh anyway yeah there are some more recent papers now so yeah     
42:38     
just okay what else you want to do uh well I guess uh that's pretty much what     
42:45     
we had let's see if we have what this we talked about this one the stall paper I     
42:51     
don't think we talked this is the one that was the sort of the News and Views or article about this other paper that     
42:58     
you oh yeah the slide Tes paper yeah making yes making it a break     
43:06     
through yeah yeah well that's that's that's the role of every science report     
43:12     
right any any research they report I must be a breakthrough oh     
43:19     
yeah there was another thing that I think it was Morgan posted in one of the     
43:26     
the slack channels and this was a a new Atlas so I'll bring it up now uh yeah so     
43:34     
this is a tri-dimensional atlas of the developing human head so again this is another Atlas but it's basically similar     
43:42     
thing where they basically take human embryos they do tissue clearing so they     
43:48     
do you know they clar uh clarify the tissue is that still legal I don't know     
43:53     
what stage they're at but they're doing yeah no I said is it still legal I don't     
44:00     
know you know we went through a period where you couldn't do anything with the human embryo oh yeah I don't know I I I     
44:07     
guess it is because it's published in cell so uh anyways they did this tissue     
44:15     
clearance which will make tissues like transparent but it's a process that     
44:21     
doesn't allow you to recover anything like it would have to be extent so or couldn't be extent you know you wouldn't     
44:27     
be able to get any more cell divisions and then you have light sheet microscopy     
44:32     
so you acquire image stacks and again the image Stacks you know you can     
44:38     
reference them spatially but you still have these IM whatever is in the frame of the image that's what you get you     
44:44     
have to then reconstruct it then they have this mesh reconstruction where they reconstruct     
44:50     
inside the you know they kind of infer from the image stack what the I guess     
44:56     
this is the nerves or connections between the cells and then they do VR     
45:02     
segmentation which I guess they're using uh virtual reality to uh segment some of     
45:08     
these images then they have a data portal interactive uh website and then the 3D     
45:15     
printed model which is where they print out the images yeah okay so this is     
45:23     
uh pretty pretty uh you know bringing all tools to the party I guess yeah and     
45:29     
it's very low resolution compared to 86 billion cells yeah     
45:34     
yeah so they're but they're able to get this uh you know head embryogenesis     
45:40     
encompassing muscles vasculature cartilage peripheral nerves and exine     
45:47     
exocrine glands uh and then this data is used to provide insights into the branching     
45:53     
morphogenesis of exocrine glands so so just one of those the branching morphogenesis they just want to look at     
46:00     
what that's you know that n work looks like and then features of neurovascular and skeletomuscular structure     
46:08     
development so this really kind of does so this is that.com did they do it on TW did they     
46:15     
do it on twins oh I don't know let's look at the methods um probably not no I don't think     
46:25     
so be hard to get twin embryos because then you could look at the variation yeah so     
46:32     
okay a total of 76 specimens were used including 27     
46:37     
embryos and 49 fetuses no twins no and     
46:42     
they had male and female and seven unknown all images are from single samples and are not average     
46:48     
reconstructions of multiple samples so I don't know how that worked I guess they stitch together uh they just kind of     
46:56     
went over glossed over the variation I don't know oh no said from single sample     
47:01     
oh okay so yeah uh the correspondence between samples and figure panels or     
47:07     
movies is provided in table D1 or s1d which is supplemental data here I can't     
47:13     
access it right now but uh this is at Huda do uh gen.org     
47:21     
this is the French Huda bioman so this is the actual website     
47:26     
that they have the atlas itself so this is actually this was a     
47:32     
three-year program to build a reference of embryonic and Fetal human cell types     
47:38     
so again this is kind of what this yeah so they have this and then you     
47:43     
can browse the omix data and a 3D collection     
47:48     
so and then uh yeah yeah it's just awesome yeah yeah     
47:56     
yeah and so yeah this is an analysis of the pondoc cranium development so they     
48:02     
have like this is where they're looking at bone structure and kind of breaking     
48:07     
down different parts of it this is more you know just anatomical this isn't like     
48:13     
cell lineage but it kind of gives you all this information here yeah so it's it's super useful for     
48:21     
you know people who are looking at like lifespan EEG though right yeah yeah when     
48:29     
if you're getting EEG at different stages of development and this is this is just     
48:36     
taking it down to a level I never thought we would actually have yeah yeah     
48:41     
um yeah but uh but fetal fetal fetal Imaging is also you know even in utero     
48:49     
fetal Imaging is is really hot and and um um you know just in Imaging in     
48:56     
general you know like rsna kind of meetings lot of lot of interest in in     
49:04     
fetal Imaging and yeah so this kind of um this kind of ground trth model is is     
49:11     
just great so why why the interest in fetal Imaging as opposed to other types     
49:16     
of Imaging well just just you know an example in terms of this this case but     
49:23     
uh you know again it's just about getting it's about getting the     
49:29     
development right so you know the um um     
49:34     
just like the organoids uh are starting to show you know kind of physiological     
49:39     
rhythms at such such early stages um you know being able to capture     
49:46     
the rhythms as they change you know I mean it's really interesting how sleep changes in the you know first years of     
49:53     
life right so just the your sleep sleepy EG changes dramatically or you know     
49:59     
continuous and recordings change so much over time in the in the early years like     
50:07     
being able to take that even further back would be you know really valuable     
50:13     
and um so getting that kind of data from say icus and you know uh is something     
50:21     
that uh that there's there's some groups here UCSF that do that     
50:26     
right you know it's only like single recording or you know single Channel maybe maybe two channel but um uh uh you     
50:34     
know I've talked to some of the people like trying to trying to trying to get them interested in a 64 Channel     
50:41     
system to to you know one of these nets but uh again it's these These     
50:48     
are you know babies that are are it's I don't want to say sick but you know it's     
50:55     
it's getting getting permission to work with them is very difficult when they're so fragile you know and     
51:04     
and so there's just Yeah by doing in you know in in in utero Imaging and being     
51:13     
able to to do say Meg is something that people are interested in just to get     
51:18     
that kind of just to see what that kind of change is like in at earlier stages     
51:26     
yeah you know tell tell us more you know just just looking at slack while while     
51:32     
you guys are talking and and saw um Jesse's comments of well it was really     
51:38     
you know posting somebody else's Twitter right yeah about how you know with entropy and complexity we're we're in     
51:44     
the age of measures looking for measures and I was going to say something like     
51:51     
well except you know except the people who are doing no modeling sorry my dogs     
51:57     
are fighting but uh you know the neural     
52:03     
modeling people um are you know with real generative models you you can uh     
52:09     
you can hopefully say something actually physiological right yeah and just how     
52:15     
how the physiology is changing you know is one of the easiest non-invasive     
52:22     
ways uh to capture how the physiology is changing is from from capturing that     
52:27     
that endogenous electrical activity right right so that's that's the     
52:33     
certainly the interest but I would say also Morgan     
52:38     
what's the spatial resolution     
52:43     
of like in in utero Imaging well in any     
52:49     
such yeah yeah so it um it depends you     
52:54     
know I mean obviously it's going to depend on the the age of the the fetus um you know     
53:03     
like the more the the later the better in terms of the the the signal that you have um     
53:13     
and um so I would need to I need to check     
53:18     
on my two dogs sorry you can eat that bird     
53:31     
so the one the one's not letting the other into a bed     
53:39     
oh so you know when when we have     
53:44     
um uh if if the if the fetus is close you     
53:51     
know close to the the you know the belly where we've got we got the doer I mean     
53:57     
I'm talking Meg here although honestly I don't think it would really matter you know EG would     
54:05     
be this isn't a case where Meg I think has a um I think the real benefit you     
54:12     
get with the Meg is just you get the sensors in place super fast but but you probably don't get the um they probably     
54:19     
don't get around the belly very well um you know the doers the I wonder what you     
54:26     
could do with maybe opms now that to allow you to have more flexibility on     
54:32     
where the the magnetic sensors can be placed but um anyway you know we would     
54:39     
say you know five to 10 millimeters you     
54:44     
know probably uh um which again is is is huge right uh so you're you're really     
54:52     
going for kind of one single ver virtual Channel you know you're kind of using     
54:57     
all your sensors to try and get one you know one channel of data U how much that     
55:06     
um how much is missing from that boxal or how much extra stuff you've got in     
55:11     
that box it's a big noise I mean big noise     
55:17     
problem Morgan let me ask you a question are you     
55:22     
famili familiar with electrical competenc tomography yeah yes I'm     
55:27     
actually one of the one of the few people probably is yeah yeah so we were doing it yeah we were doing it back in     
55:34     
the 90s because you know we we were trying to make an EG system that could     
55:40     
compete with an Meg system right and the Meg was was uh uh able to you know     
55:46     
basically wasn't influenced by the skull and it's it's the spatial smoothing that     
55:53     
the skull U does with the EG so the idea that our CEO had or you know the the the     
56:01     
company that I joined had was you know we'll we'll do electrical impedance tomography with the high with a high     
56:08     
high density EG net and that would allow us to to then     
56:15     
yeah use use you know computational physics to see through the skull I can tell you about yeah I once     
56:23     
designed an electric impedance tomography device that would be used for     
56:30     
embryos oh which might be H one might be able to do it with very high resolution     
56:36     
yeah yeah yeah well it was um the paper that Amanda dropped in in orthogonal     
56:44     
slack uh um you know I I didn't recognize the author it's a Asian name I     
56:50     
I don't know if you know him Bradley but um said that he was working in bioelectricity of     
56:57     
embryogenesis okay I don't know I haven't looked at it yet I think it's in like methods of methods     
57:07     
cognition sorry let me let me just see but uh um you know it's uh yeah methods     
57:14     
kogai projects um but that sounds really interesting d i I'd love to you know I     
57:21     
mean again like this yeah I uh I helped supervise PhD     
57:28     
thesis on EIT for breast yeah yeah yeah yeah so I mean I     
57:34     
was going to EIT conferences um back in like oh like     
57:41     
2004 um 2003 and um uh this would have     
57:46     
been 20 years earlier got it okay okay okay gotcha gotcha well you know but     
57:52     
that was one of the that was definitely one of the application areas like like like us showing up doing doing the heads     
58:01     
uh was you know we were we were by ourselves yeah okay yeah I'd like see     
58:07     
Bradley that might EIT could possibly solve the transparency problem for     
58:12     
embryos oh yeah okay because it'll go right through the it doesn't care about     
58:20     
pigmentation yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's interesting right um but it's also     
58:29     
really interesting in terms of um you know like uh like your stuff and like     
58:37     
you were the one first told me that that um bi electricity is important in ID     
58:43     
Genesis yeah it is and anybody yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I     
58:51     
I I was gonna say this is this is all 11 stuff but it's you know it is go it goes     
58:57     
back a hundred years yeah yeah that's awesome you know as someone who had to     
59:03     
read d uh in college oh I think that's awesome he into     
59:11     
electrical properties but there uh I think in a book I wrote I think I listed     
59:16     
the uh this was published in 99 and I listed the papers that I found     
59:23     
on electric properties of fish embryos interesting okay okay okay yeah     
59:31     
yeah okay which went back to around 1900 yeah yeah yeah I mean so I mean I'm I'm     
59:39     
looking for more references on this and um you know I I would love anything     
59:45     
you've got uh or you know you you definitely recommend oh I I haven't thought about     
59:51     
it for years but the uh well I mean is this is this a you know is this a widely     
59:58     
studied area now I haven't checked I don't know yeah I mean I'm super curious     
1:00:04     
doubt it no I doubt it I think what I'm suggesting is that it might be practical     
1:00:10     
to build an theit oh yeah oh yeah     
1:00:15     
mic not only that but uh uh now the um oh what's her name um M's ey Side by     
1:00:25     
Medical Imaging uh Jean rnol and um and Jean's     
1:00:32     
Jean's this awesome biomedical engineer who also presents at chaos Computing um     
1:00:39     
which is you know a big uh it's a big hacker convention um so you can see you     
1:00:45     
can see one of her talks at CCC but um she's she made a a great you     
1:00:54     
know kit for people um that allows you to do EIT in a     
1:01:01     
dish and um you know I I don't think she's got a current run well she she did     
1:01:06     
this then she she started her PhD at Imperial um doing I she never really     
1:01:14     
told me what but I I guessed it was like Photo acoustic Imaging anyway she started her PhD and like two months     
1:01:23     
later you know pandemic lockdown happened and uh you know she was also     
1:01:29     
she also had a new baby like like she had a hard time with     
1:01:35     
that um but uh depends on the husband well you know they were they were just     
1:01:42     
trapped in a very small apartment in London is is why it was hard you know uh     
1:01:48     
but uh yeah definitely um but I I'm super curious to know what she working     
1:01:55     
on now but like like her kit is you know again because she open sources all her     
1:02:01     
designs and things um is is just a it's a perfect example of what you would what     
1:02:07     
you would make I mean if if not um uh I mean I don't know how small the the     
1:02:13     
embryos that you want to image are oh probably you know half half to a     
1:02:21     
couple millimeters okay so yeah so this is you know it would be shrinking her stuff     
1:02:27     
down I mean getting getting it such that it's you know almost a chip the these     
1:02:33     
days is actually uh something that's pretty doable too and um uh you know the     
1:02:40     
kind of equipment that they've been building to do um you know what I would call more sophisticated cerebral     
1:02:47     
organoid work is um would be you know very very uh very approp apprpriate for     
1:02:54     
it I mean John Hopkins built little little mini helmets I mean they called     
1:03:00     
them mini helmets all they just meant was that you know because of the the way     
1:03:06     
you make the organoids you you end up with spheres um uh that that it's it's     
1:03:14     
appropriate it's not again it's just good to say it's not a brain let me let me take a minute here     
1:03:22     
and I can let's see there the Whiteboard on here let I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna be getting     
1:03:30     
um some kids to school so but I'm listening listening okay okay can you     
1:03:37     
see white yeah I can't see it yet or     
1:03:42     
yeah okay let me uh command on this     
1:03:49     
thing oh there it is live okay okay I'm just     
1:03:54     
going to draw lines okay so here here is a     
1:04:01     
baseboard and here are     
1:04:07     
electrodes okay I won't draw them off and here's an Em still not still not     
1:04:15     
sharing still not sharing know why     
1:04:21     
not uh I can share my screen should work can you see it gra I can yeah oh     
1:04:32     
you so there's my screen if you can see it okay so I can see that I start draw     
1:04:38     
an embryo but it should be roughly a sphere sitting on top of these     
1:04:44     
electrodes now Morgan am I correct that it's possible to address any pair of     
1:04:53     
electrodes well yeah I mean that or certainly that that in our system yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so you address a     
1:04:59     
pair of electrodes the current goes out one and it goes through the embryo comes back through the other that gives you     
1:05:06     
one image so to speak of the embryo and you do it with different pairs and you build up the three-dimensional     
1:05:13     
structure okay so it's a very simple design obviously hard to build     
1:05:19     
but and you know you're used to something like axles or fish embryo you do it     
1:05:30     
underwater you could you could have the solution outside the embryo would usually be a weak saline     
1:05:38     
solution so you get conductivity through the solution     
1:05:43     
too is that do you understand that in other words uh yeah I'm just     
1:05:51     
sorry little busy here     
1:05:57     
okay okay so you have a huge array of electrodes you take any pair of them you run current from one through     
1:06:05     
that pair it goes up into the embryo and down that gives you a sort of electrical impedance image     
1:06:13     
of that embryo through that pair and then you change     
1:06:20     
pairs so you can get many views of an embryo and uh it should be possible to     
1:06:27     
calculate the uh uh the 3D     
1:06:34     
structure as I said it doesn't matter if the embryo is opaque or     
1:06:40     
not okay okay maybe we should do a paper uh     
1:06:49     
more sophisticated than this on how to build an EIT microscope     
1:06:56     
yeah' be interesting I think that would be awesome I mean I you know again I I'll     
1:07:02     
when I um when I'm free later today I will um I will pull the uh the U the     
1:07:12     
equipment design that um I forget if it was JHU or or you know sometimes they     
1:07:17     
Outsource to uh the Applied Physics lab there and um okay uh uh but anyway like     
1:07:26     
like this should be I mean if if L and and you know the the the others that     
1:07:32     
he's building on building on top of um uh are correct um you know this is like     
1:07:40     
really important to capture the the bioelectric uh you know     
1:07:47     
organization it goes back I mean for instance I don't know are you familiar with Lano jeffy's work on this     
1:07:54     
uh now that name does sound familiar why is that uh he worked on all kinds of     
1:08:00     
waves and embryos okay then maybe maybe it was something that um because I read your     
1:08:07     
paper um um you had draft paper uh back     
1:08:13     
a a year ago now has that been published I don't know I don't keep     
1:08:21     
track well uh it probably is from from one of your     
1:08:28     
papers that I've I've seen that name before yeah okay well like what Lionel did is he found that the neural plate of     
1:08:35     
the chicken has a huge electric current that comes out of it yes yeah yeah now     
1:08:40     
it was definitely you who who told me this yeah yeah yeah yeah so uh and I don't think anyone did anything with it     
1:08:48     
wow that's that's just that's amazing that nobody's done it yeah well you know     
1:08:54     
new discoveries are Beyond most people well like you said it would be     
1:09:00     
really important to have this kind of equipment and uh stupid question can you use EIT     
1:09:08     
equipment to uh measure active electricity in an     
1:09:15     
embryo no you go back and I mean you go back and forth right so I mean it's you     
1:09:21     
can do you you we we we call it from this is the MRI term but uh you know     
1:09:28     
transmit and receive you know so uh you do you know you use the the the high     
1:09:36     
density to you know Source image and um and then the EIT to you know probe     
1:09:44     
probe the material or probe the probe the field you know okay but     
1:09:51     
there's you can't use the same electrodes to pick up a electric signal     
1:09:57     
generated by the embryo uh well you use the other electrodes right so you're you're I mean     
1:10:04     
this is the benefit of having or certainly for us the benefit of having like 256 channels is that we're doing     
1:10:12     
doing random pairs to to oh I'm thinking more by five is 512 by 512 sure sure     
1:10:19     
sure a two-dimensional array of electrons yeah yeah yeah so you're you're using some to     
1:10:28     
to to transmit and some to record and yes if you can address which     
1:10:34     
is which yes yeah yeah so that's that's all like again like jeans um uh jeans     
1:10:42     
equipment which is just a 32 Channel you know demo like uh for 2D you know it's     
1:10:50     
it's cool for the kind of stuff that um that you do kind of like MRI microscopy     
1:10:55     
or you know diffusion weighted Imaging um you know take a slice of like a melon     
1:11:01     
or something like that right and and you know put it in this dish and um and you     
1:11:06     
can see the you can capture some of the the changes in structure um uh so yeah     
1:11:15     
you you you know all of that's implemented in the the microcontroller however however you made     
1:11:20     
the electronics but um but and and um you know again like like Lan     
1:11:28     
says you know he's stealing stealing from Neuroscience you know stealing     
1:11:33     
tools from Neuroscience to study uh um you know bio electricity's role in     
1:11:39     
spatial morph for Genesis I mean this would be a this would be a great one because um and it uh it was really great     
1:11:48     
to see um what was her name Ellen cool uh it's like k     
1:11:55     
L the the living matter Lab at Stanford because they're doing all the     
1:12:01     
kind of finite element modeling and and um you know they they were only familiar     
1:12:09     
with things like MRI um uh elastography and things like that but you know like     
1:12:17     
i' I've wanted to get in touch with them tell them about you know electrical edance tomography and other techniques     
1:12:22     
that they could be too yeah okay well uh she her she the living     
1:12:29     
matter lab is is has as a focus um brain brain     
1:12:35     
tissue it's like physics physics a brain physical physics modeling of brain     
1:12:49     
tissue it's a it's a rainy day here in San Francisco and for some reason kids are not getting     
1:12:55     
up okay them up I I I will be listening but uh feel distracted here okay     
1:13:04     
well interesting maybe maybe we can do something with     
1:13:22     
this okay Bradley we may have solved the     
1:13:28     
problem okay that's great okay yeah okay because     
1:13:33     
uh if electrical impedance demography will work as I said it's independent of     
1:13:39     
pigment it'll go right through the embryo okay uh and the question is can we achieve the spatial resolution     
1:13:48     
necessary Lage stre yeah it's that that's tougher but     
1:13:55     
um uh H it's not that it's not that tough     
1:14:00     
with n nanot technology nowadays well you know there's there's there's some     
1:14:07     
limitations though in the kind of the the farfield measurements you know so     
1:14:12     
yeah you're you're doing an inverse problem that's you know but field for us     
1:14:19     
is a millimeter or two yeah now now what's what's cool though and and I this     
1:14:26     
is what I'm hoping to hear from from Jean uh is um the what people are trying     
1:14:33     
to do in terms of combining like ultrasounds with     
1:14:39     
electrical impi demography oh and yeah what's the spatial resolution     
1:14:48     
on ultrasound well it it's better and um     
1:14:54     
and uh but even together they you can     
1:15:00     
use a multiphysics approach and actually get uh U you know that they complement     
1:15:07     
each other so um you're you're able to um you know again like let me um Let me     
1:15:17     
let me get this this sleepy head out um and I will follow up with some     
1:15:24     
references and things that I think be really exciting um yeah of course any     
1:15:30     
anything else like x-ray uh uh where you do x-ray microscop     
1:15:37     
microscop yeah tomography now yeah yeah     
1:15:42     
yeah it's hard to compete you know and and you know it's like people you know     
1:15:49     
people like especially in like the focused ultrasounds you know research Searchers um you know they're typically     
1:15:56     
using like microscopy or certainly Optical Imaging you know small scale animal prep     
1:16:03     
that they can then you know which kind of gives them ground truth and then they can compare that against what they're     
1:16:09     
getting with with you know their focused ultrasound techniques and things like that you know so it's hard to it's hard     
1:16:17     
to beat that um when you get a chance Bradley record the session right yeah     
1:16:24     
yeah okay when you get a chance Morgan you might want to uh review this session because earlier we were discussing the     
1:16:32     
problem of creating lineage trees foran embryos yeah yeah yeah it's um you know     
1:16:41     
I I'd be curious you know um I mean it'd be good to see what um what they are     
1:16:48     
capable of um and oh they aren't yet that's the problem     
1:16:54     
yeah yeah but you know but like uh like you said you know or as Levan shows that     
1:17:00     
like capturing the electric Fields is is a necessary you know it's totally     
1:17:06     
necessary you know component of this and um so I I think it'll be definitely a     
1:17:14     
really interesting oh yeah yeah I agree I've been I've been after Mike Levan for     
1:17:19     
years to try to combine his bioelectric work with the differentiation tree     
1:17:25     
approach and uh he's he's just off in his own world he won't he won't     
1:17:31     
budge he's off in a great world oh yeah yeah but it's a but it's     
1:17:37     
got its limitations sure you know I mean it's like looking at the moon and saying     
1:17:43     
gee I see the moon can glow and saying well what do you know about the geology of the Moon not much yeah yeah     
1:17:52     
yeah little surface topology maybe but you got to go there and figure it     
1:18:03     
out all right well that's a great great conversation yeah let's follow up on     
1:18:09     
that and see what happens yeah yeah I think uh well with Morgan     
1:18:16     
having any experience in theit this could be made uh quite     
1:18:22     
realistic yeah okay and it might solve the electrical iMed it might solve the uh     
1:18:30     
the transparency problem right     
1:18:35     
okay but I think I think that may be the key uh yeah there's it's cool too     
1:18:43     
because there there's packages that are um like supported software packages     
1:18:49     
available like Sim nibs um that uh that weren't designed for kind of EIT     
1:18:58     
they were designed for you know trans cranial electrical stimulation you know kind of neurom modulation work but um     
1:19:05     
but they can totally you know that it's all there for you to to use them as as     
1:19:10     
EIT modeling packages oh okay okay it's     
1:19:16     
all good you know finite element stuff okay again I'm really really     
1:19:21     
interested to see what living matter lab thinks of of this and kind of you know I I say I mean again     
1:19:29     
like I'm focused on the head because our subjects have been older um good see we if you     
1:19:38     
look uh we've been looking at what are called cell atlases and brain atlases     
1:19:44     
and they concluded they are not atlases at all okay but uh same problem they they     
1:19:54     
they have not solved the problem of of good lineage tracking or differentiation tree     
1:20:02     
tracking cells the brain yeah yeah okay     
1:20:07     
yeah isn't it because that they're they're destructive I mean no no it's     
1:20:14     
not because they're destructive it's because they uh in the living organism they just can't get the     
1:20:21     
resolution to follow individual cells so we've been talk we've been talking about     
1:20:27     
okay how about dealing with an organism with bigger cells we're talking about dealing with     
1:20:33     
one that's transparent but maybe with the it and x-ray techniques you don't     
1:20:39     
need transparency either okay so uh you know it might be     
1:20:47     
possible interesting yeah yeah yeah okay right yeah these people are     
1:20:54     
struggling they've got lots of money and they don't really know what to do with it because they're they would like to need the next     
1:21:02     
thing analogous to the Human Genome Project but they don't know where to     
1:21:08     
go we're hoping for a breakthrough in the next two     
1:21:15     
years yeah sounds great we've been going over that literature yeah     
1:21:21     
yeah okay you want to call it a day yeah let's call it a day uh thanks for attending everyone and uh yeah take care     
1:21:28     
take care thank you thank you bye by thank you everyone yeah thank you bye thank you goodbye all right now I wanted     
1:21:35     
to talk about a few things to close out our 20123 meting series uh this is open     
1:21:42     
questions for 2024 so this was something that dick Gordon who was in this meeting talking     
1:21:48     
about some of the things about atlases uh he sent me these question questions and I wanted to go over them a     
1:21:55     
little bit and you know people are interested in collaborating on them please let us know so these are open     
1:22:03     
questions uh this is based on his life's work and he'd like to pursue some of     
1:22:08     
these uh in the latter part of his life and you know these are interesting     
1:22:14     
questions that come from Decades of work and you know it has a deep history in a     
1:22:20     
lot of the things that we're doing in the group the first question actually is I think something that something that people have wondered about but is     
1:22:28     
something maybe we're uniquely suited to answer or I guess it's more of a     
1:22:33     
statement than a question and that is the changing network of neighbors from     
1:22:38     
the point of view of one cell in embryo so we do work with embryo networks and we've seen these in     
1:22:44     
meetings where we have networks of cells that are connected through some     
1:22:50     
Criterion it could be distance Rel ations it could be signaling it could be     
1:22:57     
anatomical affinity and all these you know uh     
1:23:02     
relationships can form a network and that Network NE necessarily changes over     
1:23:08     
time as you get the dynamic processes of embryogenesis and a plasticity and a     
1:23:15     
function and behavior and so what he's saying here is that we would like to look at the nwork     
1:23:22     
of neighbors but not just you know from the top down looking at it sort of you     
1:23:29     
know as an observer but from the point of view of one of the cells in in an embryo so the idea that one of the cells     
1:23:38     
in this network is an observer and is observing like changing connections     
1:23:44     
within its own network so imagine you're maybe a neuron or some sort of developing cell and     
1:23:52     
you're trying to establish connections with your neighbors in the embryo and you know how would you go     
1:23:58     
about doing that what would your view be from the vantage point of being a single cell what would your view of the embryo     
1:24:05     
be and what would your view of your neighbors be so it's kind of an interesting question we worked on some     
1:24:11     
of these in agent based models uh We've developed in in my other group we've develop things with respect     
1:24:18     
to Viewpoint networks and that kind of fits into some of this stuff on embryo     
1:24:25     
networks so that might be an interesting place to bring those two things together so I think it's an really     
1:24:32     
interesting question and people don't generally think about networks that way     
1:24:37     
they don't think about neural networks that way they don't think about complex networks that way and people certainly     
1:24:43     
don't think about like neuronal networks or Neuroscience networks that way so I     
1:24:49     
think it's an interesting question and and maybe it's something we can follow up on so there's no seed publication for     
1:24:57     
this but for the second two questions we actually we do have some seed     
1:25:03     
Publications so the first one is can we shift datom or more generally cells now     
1:25:08     
we work with datom in the seed paper you'll see that it focuses on datom but we work on other     
1:25:16     
types of cells as well and this could apply to other types of cells can we shift datom or cell     
1:25:23     
from one category to another with something called a comput step and so what is a comput step and so     
1:25:30     
if we go back to 1996 uh Richard Gordon published a paper     
1:25:35     
called computer controlled evolution of diatoms designed for a copy stat this     
1:25:41     
paper is not available online it's from a very obscure     
1:25:47     
Journal Nova hedwigia bar it's some German     
1:25:53     
publication so this is something you'd have to contact us for access to but um     
1:26:00     
it kind of goes through the chemostat the idea of a chemostat and chemostat is     
1:26:06     
actually something that they use experimentally in microbiology the chemostat allows us to select for the     
1:26:12     
fastest growing mutants of a microorganism population under new T limitation so this is a experimental     
1:26:19     
chemostat that you would put cells in and you could actually do the these kind of U selection experiments for fast     
1:26:27     
growing mutants since morphology and motility are the major distinguishing characteristics of     
1:26:32     
datom I propose instead of a instead construction of a Compu stat and the Cy     
1:26:39     
stat is continuous computer vision monitoring of every cell in a datm culture chamber so this is where you     
1:26:46     
have datm and you're culturing them in a culture dish and the idea would be that     
1:26:52     
you would monitor every cell with a computer vision this is back in     
1:26:58     
1996 so you know today that's not like a huge problem necessarily you would just     
1:27:03     
take video of it and you'd be able to monitor uh different parameters maybe     
1:27:08     
use some sort of machine learning to extract the realtime data and would give     
1:27:15     
you information about that uh and then you could use laser     
1:27:20     
micro beam calling according to program Criterion so when you identify cells that are underperforming or don't have     
1:27:28     
the right properties you can zap them with a laser micr beam and we have a     
1:27:33     
population of competent dietone cells in the culture a compy stack could provide us     
1:27:40     
with the ability to determine just how fast we D we can drive artificial selection and evolution of datom when we     
1:27:48     
select for morphological Andor behavioral mutants so we can create mutants uh in datom as     
1:27:56     
well as in microorganisms and we can then drive artificial selection meaning that we're     
1:28:02     
doing the selecting instead of nature so we can do this and we can evolve     
1:28:08     
populations of datom or other cells in a     
1:28:14     
uh culture but I kind of wanted to go beyond that and think about digital Evolution where we can do build like um     
1:28:23     
digital models of cells and things like that so we could do this same process     
1:28:28     
with digital models of cells we could use a generative model to generate a series of cells and then select upon     
1:28:36     
those cells for desired traits and then see what happens with that model so you     
1:28:43     
know it's kind of an interesting area um I wasn't aware of this paper kind of     
1:28:48     
brought it to my attention but I think it might be a nice project to do um in some way so basically takes that     
1:28:55     
idea of the chemostat the microbiology it brings it into the realm of diatoms     
1:29:02     
but we can also bring this into the realm of digital um simulation as well     
1:29:08     
okay so the third question involves early development of cecilian OFA and so     
1:29:14     
this is a group of organisms that I pulled up here and these are     
1:29:19     
amphibians that are Isis then look like worms but they're actually amphibians so     
1:29:25     
they have these this nice morphology it's not a model system that a lot of     
1:29:32     
people work with so it's one of these obscure model organism systems that we can learn a lot about uh but people have     
1:29:39     
worked with this for a long time uh this is a review of the Wier with a translation of sarasin and Sison     
1:29:47     
from 1889 it's on the developmental history and anatomy of the salon blind     
1:29:53     
burrower iopus glutinosus and so this is a pretty     
1:29:59     
obscure I mean you'd have to be interested in sort of literature review and maybe the history biology as well as     
1:30:06     
early development and obscure model organisms so this doesn't involve any     
1:30:11     
biology per se it review involves a review of the literature but it can be     
1:30:17     
linked to um biology as well and so this     
1:30:22     
actually is a seed paper this is a paper that uh Richard Gordon wrote with Vincent flurry this is uncoupling of     
1:30:29     
growth differentiation of morphogenesis an integrated approach to design in     
1:30:35     
embryogenesis so in this this is a book chapter origins of design in nature which is just kind of going over um     
1:30:43     
things in nature that uh appear to be designed or whatever and then this kind     
1:30:49     
of talks about some of these uh these are some of the parts of the paper so this just goes through a number     
1:30:55     
of models uh where you have uh basically it talks this is from     
1:31:03     
1990 or this is from 2012 but this talks a lot about a lot of     
1:31:08     
the uh mechanical and physical aspects of development that we talk about in the     
1:31:15     
group now so the abstract reads where's increasing evidence at cellular     
1:31:21     
difference iation is induced by mechanical stresses either Shear which is dislocation of different cells     
1:31:28     
compressive stresses like gastation and cartilage formation or tensile stress     
1:31:34     
which something like plant buing uh and so they kind of go through this um if     
1:31:40     
differentiation is induced by components of the stress tensor it might be possible to boil down morphogenesis to a     
1:31:46     
closed biomechanical equation incorporating growth morphogenesis and different differentiation encapsulated     
1:31:53     
at a single framework in order to progress such towards such Clos models or discover their an adequacies or     
1:32:00     
important questions need to be answered first exactly what is the mechanical     
1:32:06     
nature of living material second what forces Drive the deformation rates in the mechanical     
1:32:12     
field third how cellular differentiation is spacially organized then fourth how     
1:32:18     
differentiation spreads and six we have a number of things here we have constitutive     
1:32:25     
equations we have movement growth or you know combination of the two we have uh     
1:32:34     
the first spots of differentiation in where they're localized and then for the fourth thing     
1:32:39     
how differentiation spreads or migrates throughout the or the embryo so we have     
1:32:45     
all these different components we have equations we have modes of change we     
1:32:51     
have have some of this these organizational aspects and then     
1:32:57     
additional organizational aspects and so they do they talk about a lot of this they talk about measures     
1:33:04     
they talk about things like self-organized buckling as an example of outter plane folding they talk about uh     
1:33:13     
differentiation being initiated at singularities of vector Fields during cell migration that's another example um     
1:33:22     
and so in in all of this work they site this paper that I talked about using     
1:33:28     
Sicilians in aoda and so you can use these very obscure model organisms to     
1:33:35     
inform some of these things because they offer uh unique uh examples of some of     
1:33:40     
these processes so in the paper here they also have specific examples that are     
1:33:47     
addressed such as gastrulation I formation cart looping and tissue     
1:33:52     
buckling which kind of incorporate this framework um and get or potentially     
1:33:59     
explain better so those are our open questions for 2024 people are welcome in     
1:34:06     
our group to answer any kind of question they want but these are three that perhaps if people are interested we     
1:34:12     
could follow up on
