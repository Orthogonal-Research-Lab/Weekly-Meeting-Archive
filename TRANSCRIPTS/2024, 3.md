hello good morning morning very good Ved     
0:09     
Morgan good to see you uh so looks like uh think Susan said     
0:16     
she wouldn't be coming in and does anyone have any updates before we     
0:23     
start I mentioned um not in Diva but there's going to be a microscopy course     
0:31     
at workshop at um at Berkeley this week okay so looks like a a lot of really     
0:39     
interesting speakers so really excited     
0:45     
to um it's it's the one really big     
0:51     
technical Gap I I feel like I have yeah and you know absolutely important in     
0:59     
terms of molecular cellular well absolutely important in terms of     
1:04     
cellular um multicellular work for for Imaging you know what I mean yeah yeah     
1:12     
like well science like it's not even just IM you know     
1:17     
it's you know being able to track what you're doing at that     
1:23     
scale yeah so it looks looks like a really interesting set of topics and um     
1:28     
so I I think I the I think there's a program attached     
1:35     
to what I posted there and could could you know let me know if     
1:41     
anything's of particular interest in terms of taking notes or hello everybody     
1:48     
yeah hi yeah thanks Morgan for that Hi V how     
1:53     
are you hi thank you fine you have any     
2:00     
any updates or uh for today     
2:05     
yeah um should I've been uh in contact     
2:11     
with Dr Gordon for some Works uh and the other one we were talking about I was     
2:18     
just uh a little uh waiting somehow for     
2:24     
for for the data that we are talking about we need some uh la stage data uh     
2:31     
if you have any papers that uh could suggest there are maybe some electrophysiological data uh in addition     
2:39     
to the lar stage of the C I can uh work uh a little deeper on on the paper I     
2:48     
discussed last week but if not I have to do some review papers on uh some uh     
2:55     
simulations that or some comparison between the uh artificial neet force that derived     
3:03     
from the Elegance as we T but my my what is more     
3:11     
interest for me is to be able to simulate those lar was I was talking     
3:16     
about so that uh we could have uh     
3:22     
difference uh if if we have uh any type of data     
3:28     
that could uh represent and the different like physiological characteristics of this different L     
3:35     
stage I could actually work on that type of paper much better than something like     
3:41     
just a review paper yeah I I I guess I shared uh the draph     
3:49     
with you so at that at the part of the graph that I wrote some questions if you     
3:56     
had any uh if you have seen this so far any references that uh contain uh even     
4:04     
if it contains some uh uh plots that could be digitized that would be useful     
4:12     
as well something like the main paper that I discussed in the draft but uh in     
4:18     
other lar St ofs yeah so for example we say if there     
4:24     
are for example lot four steps that's uh the movements of seon is going to be uh     
4:32     
to get mature as C is     
4:38     
somehow uh goes up uh that could     
4:45     
be something that could actually be working yeah yeah I think so and there     
4:52     
should be uh getting feedback     
4:57     
here uh so yeah let me see if     
5:04     
I there we go I think that's it's just the microphone uh so yeah there's U I think     
5:11     
there's some data on electrophysiology in the larvel worm I don't know exactly     
5:17     
where it is I know there's a good set of data sets on synapses that reconfigure     
5:23     
during uh the larel different larel stages I know there's some work on um     
5:30     
like the d stage and I think there's some electrophysiology on that but I have to check on um some of the you know I have     
5:38     
to go check and see what's actually available because generally the celegans community is pretty good on you know     
5:45     
making data available and having things sort of aligned in a way that's you know     
5:51     
allows you to take multiple data sets and put them together so um I'll have to check into that I'm     
5:59     
going to talk today a little bit about like the timing of embryogenetic     
6:05     
development uh next week maybe I'll talk about laral development yeah and actually I guess we     
6:12     
could just start with just having three or four data uh it would be enough for     
6:18     
example the data in the the for example fourth day of uh St labr St in the for     
6:26     
example eth day it's something specific like this uh I mean something that could be an average of the movement in uh for     
6:34     
example uh studying 100 seon in their fourth day their for example Eighth Day     
6:40     
or 15th day something like that some specific data that could be actually     
6:47     
discriminated between four or five different uh days of its life and so uh     
6:55     
then we could uh simulate those uh movements and so conclude that's how the     
7:05     
uh developments are are affecting those parameters that that you say     
7:11     
yeah yeah that would be good and uh so     
7:16     
yeah we I I'll I'll try to see what we can put together I actually looked at your document and you had some pretty     
7:23     
nice uh sort of outline a plan of attack and maybe some questions uh would you     
7:29     
mind maybe sharing your screen and bringing up that document real     
7:34     
quick right now     
7:58     
yeah     
8:11     
and one more thing uh we have been discussing uh one more subject with Dr     
8:17     
Gordon during the past because as you know he's working on uh some actually     
8:24     
cancer phenomenon and some methods for uh yeah     
8:30     
the growth of uh cancer tors Etc yeah I was I I was thinking that if that could     
8:37     
be possible as well we we could also study some similar uh patterns in the development     
8:45     
of the cancer tumors or cells uh as as the development of the uh actually     
8:52     
embryogenetic uh studies are being discussed in the seans community so if     
8:59     
there is any uh relation or any study that has been uh has been done some     
9:06     
similarities especially on the uh on the I know that some years ago I guess two     
9:12     
or three years ago there were Nobel Prize for discovering the the watch of     
9:20     
the sell uh development yeah prolifer     
9:27     
proliferation so uh I I was suggesting actually to the G that if there could be     
9:34     
uh any uh similar idea that uh that could be studied that type of watch that     
9:41     
is actually somehow uh uh some we know that some uh cells some cancer cells are     
9:49     
uh getting uh uh are growing due to some     
9:56     
uh unrestricted uh proliferation so if there could be any uh if we could uh     
10:03     
somehow work on on the type of the genes that's uh actually due to some mutation     
10:10     
are causing uh those type of cancers similar to how uh a cell in the     
10:18     
emogen level is is growing up uh so that you could stop uh that kind of things     
10:25     
from uh uh somehow     
10:33     
uh expressed as well yeah yeah is there any studies inance with that type of     
10:42     
approach to the to the uh actually how the cancer is growing up how a cancer     
10:47     
tumor is growing up or something like that you know any s studies if that if     
10:53     
there is any uh that type of studies uh this is something I'm so interested in     
11:00     
could do I guess some great work related to cancer as well yeah so uh I don't     
11:07     
think there's anything in seans per se we have uh you know people who study     
11:14     
differentiation in say like mammals uh and you know in Mouse and     
11:20     
human and they do a lot of studies of directed differentiation and some of those     
11:26     
studies you can actually you know that there's sort of a wide area of like     
11:31     
cancer research because if you it turns out that some of the same Pathways for     
11:38     
like cell immortality and uh and Flur potency can also lead you down a cancer     
11:45     
pathway so depending on you know if the cell goes down you know there's some     
11:52     
there's some disregulation in the cells program that you know it goes down one pathway versus     
11:57     
another sometimes it uh goes down a you know a pathway towards blurry potency     
12:03     
sometimes it goes down a pathway towards differentiating into some type of cell     
12:09     
and sometimes it goes down the cancer pathway so those you know they're it just depends on how different genes are     
12:15     
expressed or upregulated and maybe the environmental conditions Etc uh so the there there are     
12:22     
a lot of studies there I don't think people have spent too much time in SE elegans looking at that for a number of     
12:29     
reasons but uh you know that I mean you know we do that in the group we bring in things from seans and from other species     
12:37     
and we do like comparative studies we've done a couple of those and that might be useful uh there might be some limited     
12:43     
utility in that but it's still worth you know looking into and seeing what kinds of data sets we can put     
12:50     
together I me uh for uh if you suppose that there is some type of similar some     
12:56     
some similar process in ceg proliferation that looks like a cancer     
13:01     
for example if a normal C Elegance is going to be proliferated at some stages     
13:08     
at some time uh is there any study have you ever seen any study that uh that     
13:13     
could suggest that uh a cancer cigance is growing growing up more than usual     
13:21     
something like that which like for example a cancer tomor or not um have     
13:26     
you ever seen something like that in C not I'm not familiar I don't think so I     
13:32     
think it's largely like you have defined mutants that can have different     
13:37     
mutations uh you can have you know some disregulation that leads to     
13:44     
developmental uh you know like where different cells are knocked out or something you have other types of uh     
13:51     
weird things going on with respect to metabolism but I don't know of any I     
13:57     
they don't get tumors in the same way that we get tumors so it might there there's some uh homolog homologous genes     
14:05     
that might be involved too but other than that I don't I don't think I don't think seans would be a good model for     
14:11     
cancer but I do think there's like a there's some interesting questions you could ask about uh growth and     
14:17     
development in terms of cancer because cancer is basically a a disregulation of     
14:23     
growth and development so you know if those genes are regulated in the wrong     
14:28     
way you know it can lead to uh you know aberant phenotypes as     
14:35     
they call them but yeah I yeah it' be interesting to look into literature and see people have done I'm not really     
14:41     
familiar with anything though yeah I try to se for I guess that could be a     
14:47     
question as we said is there any similarities or has anyone seen uh some     
14:53     
type of maybe a toxic environment that could cause something like cancer in     
14:59     
silicons uh any type of such uh studies I will look as well and know if there is     
15:07     
any there have been any yeah stud I know people do mutagenesis screens and seans     
15:14     
that's where they take like a toxic chemical and they expose the seans to the toxic chemical and then they just     
15:20     
see what they can get in terms of inducing mutations so you get a lot you you can generate a lot of mutations that     
15:26     
way but I'm not I don't know people have actually reported anything related to like uh you know what what the con like     
15:33     
if they found any weird things with respect to that I think it's just like screening embryos to see if they have     
15:39     
certain mutations and getting those mutations and they either like just basically die or they develop so that a     
15:47     
lot of the mutations are going to be embryonically lethal some won't be and     
15:52     
then those are the ones that you can maybe uh you know get some you know Target mutations in but     
16:00     
yeah May there may be some interesting information in that literature so so     
16:06     
yeah that that sounds really good uh thank you okay please see my I guess     
16:13     
okay uh actually this was what we were talking about last week uh and these were two main questions I had in mind     
16:21     
that if there are that type some data like these uh     
16:28     
then then I could actually uh delve into one question which was uh how we could     
16:37     
uh study and simulate Seance movement in different LEL States or in different     
16:44     
differential states of of the Seance uh these are actually maybe three     
16:51     
four or five uh could be maybe four or five different stages of the movement uh     
16:58     
if we say for example in uh in humankind we have for example uh toddler then we     
17:05     
have a baby and then we have for example a teenage and and adult and old people     
17:12     
something like that if we could have some similar uh study of of the movements of     
17:17     
C elegant for these different types with respect to the uh electrophysiological     
17:25     
data like this and also the recording of the mov we could then correlate those     
17:31     
data and uh maybe we could derive some     
17:36     
new models new developmental model that uh that uh could something like that     
17:43     
could actually uh better understand the     
17:49     
different parameters that are involved in in such model that I guess we have     
17:55     
for this model we have 29 different parameters like these and so in that way we could     
18:02     
understand how different U models both structural and     
18:08     
also uh from a behavioral point of view uh how these different paret could be     
18:15     
related to those actually uh different differential that we are talking about     
18:21     
and after that we could maybe also have some artificial neural network model     
18:28     
based on these uh different differentiated uh States so these are     
18:35     
the main questions I had in mind uh so would be glad if you uh encountered any     
18:42     
data for uh for these requirements uh I maybe could start     
18:50     
delving into this stud otherwise uh I was looking for some references to to     
18:59     
have a historical view to the development of artificial networks     
19:05     
derived from cegon or uh vice versa or we could say how we could better     
19:11     
simulate uh the uh one behavior for example The     
19:17     
Locomotion of seance from uh from it uh from the parameters and uh the the uh     
19:27     
similar or the uh somehow     
19:32     
uh the equivalent CC diagrams and its mechanical uh representation so these     
19:41     
are the two main uh tools I had in mind for uh writing this graph I gathered     
19:47     
some uh uh as you see some references for for the for the review part uh so     
19:57     
meanwhile if if I could find some interesting data as well I I would delve     
20:03     
into the second question uh after that uh there are some key maybe uh     
20:12     
references during my uh queries I actually asked some of the from chat I     
20:20     
started with uh getting some help from chity I sorted some uh key references     
20:26     
during uh this and then uh try to have a chronological     
20:35     
review to the nervous system of development elegance and uh I I again     
20:42     
try to uh get some information that's those coronal levels uh what type of a     
20:50     
studies actually have been done in that chical review and uh s to and make some     
20:59     
summary from uh that type of data uh and then I again uh try to     
21:10     
understand what type of actually artificial n networks could be uh could     
21:18     
be derived from uh that type of data and study and simulation for example if we     
21:27     
uh if we consider some uh maybe great works that have been done in uh     
21:33     
regarding to the modeling the behavior in and and also     
21:40     
and so deriving the artificial network from simple model how the simple model     
21:47     
has been uh actually get more complex as as the studies during uh the Decades of     
21:57     
1960 and until now has been uh has been get uh been more complex and complex     
22:05     
during uh this uh history again I I started to uh have some references some     
22:13     
key references and try to uh again Ask uh some more questions     
22:22     
to uh get this to somehow play with these question and get it more     
22:28     
uh uh comprehensive uh I I try to find some     
22:36     
also some uh maybe main studies that uh that has been     
22:42     
uh uh somehow directly affected the     
22:49     
the some main artificial n networks uh in in the past for the the work by uh C     
22:59     
uh I I I guess I found it one of the most impressive one in 1981 89 I     
23:06     
couldn't actually find the this paper uh it was a little uh old and uh I didn't have maybe     
23:14     
access but this was one of the main papers that I was interested to find because uh it seems that they have done     
23:22     
something great uh some maybe uh uh actually after of course     
23:29     
after some great works that have been done by uh people like     
23:39     
uher and uh w joh w Etc uh these were     
23:46     
something that uh with regard to Aral NE Network studies uh and simulation of a     
23:53     
new networks uh could be maybe uh some initial points to look into uh the uh     
24:02     
the simplest model of C gons uh at the     
24:08     
first place seon     
24:13     
uh I mean neural Circuit of the cagon and then how the neural networks of the     
24:19     
cagon have been get more simulation of gets more sophisticated so these were     
24:29     
again uh the main questions and the main papers that I     
24:36     
uh somehow der from these studies and try to again compare them with the main     
24:45     
uh Works uh that has been done during     
24:51     
the uh uh actually uh getting more and more     
24:58     
sophisticated artificial Network NE networks in in general so that's it     
25:06     
and at the end yeah     
25:11     
uh yeah yeah the end     
25:18     
of well this looks great yeah uh trying     
25:26     
to okay so yeah this looks great uh so yeah     
25:32     
you covered a lot of literature there you covered a lot of sort of next steps and that uh one of the approaches you     
25:39     
can use to sort of get a development I mean you know you can obviously get data sets and work with those uh laral     
25:46     
development we have more for laral development in like what you're looking for than in embryonic development I mean     
25:54     
embryonic development is largely you know cell tracking data Gene expr expression data     
25:59     
Etc but we can also you know if we want to build parameters of like a movement     
26:05     
model you know what we can do is take what we have in the adult and take that bottle and we know the circuits in the     
26:11     
adult we actually have pretty good papers on that pretty good characterization of the process and and     
26:16     
what networks those are and just reverse that reverse sort of reverse I guess     
26:22     
developmentally engineer it or something like that where you go back and you say what was there in the what's different     
26:29     
in the larvel stages That You Don't See in the adult and so there a lot of     
26:34     
change there's a lot of synaptic plasticity in the lar different between the different laral stages so that's a     
26:41     
that's a thing that you have to account for uh we don't really know much about the Ion channel or ION channel     
26:48     
expression changes in development in laral development in uh EMB at late     
26:54     
embryonic development it gets even more interesting because you know there is a lot of like your     
27:00     
cells that you have the developmental cells the cells that are kind of differentiating into neurons they're not     
27:06     
quite connected yet they're axons and when they are they're not quite working     
27:12     
in the way that they would work in the adult so you know we expect there to be even bigger changes in those cells uh     
27:20     
you know very early or very big differences between the late developmental stages and like the adult     
27:28     
but that's interesting because you know what is what does it mean to be sort of wire how does what does it mean to wire     
27:34     
up a connectone what does it mean to have like a bunch of cells that are basically non-committed cells you're not     
27:41     
committed to a fate and then celegans they know what their fate is going to be because there's a     
27:46     
deterministic program for most cells that that says you know you're going to be this cell but then what happens when     
27:53     
that kind of gets turned on and you start to build this network so that's the thing you know we can use these kind     
27:59     
of inverse methods where we go to the adult and we look backwards and say what's different in the embryo and then     
28:06     
we can kind of pull some of those out uh what's interesting too is that in     
28:11     
embryogenesis we have these really sort of emergent networks you know that may     
28:17     
not be fully functional as a connectome yet but they're put you know they're being put together and you know the idea     
28:25     
at least in uh in you know in principle     
28:31     
is if you manipulate like that Network early if you perturb it somehow or if     
28:36     
you remove some of the cells or if you have a defined mutant where some of the cells are knocked out essentially or     
28:43     
their function is knocked out then that means that you're going to have an effect in the adult connectome and I I I     
28:50     
know there are a lot of defined mutants for seans and I I'm not uh familiar with     
28:55     
one that's explicitly sort of perturbs the connectome other than like maybe     
29:01     
knocking out you know having an effect on certain circuits like the movement circuit and things like that so you know     
29:07     
there's a lot of work on the adult movement circuit and I know that like not only on the direct you know direct     
29:15     
movement Circuit of like forward and backward movement but there was a paper that uh I think I reviewed it last at     
29:22     
the towards the end of last year that talked about like all the all the cells     
29:27     
that kind of mediate a movement Network so you have a movement Network that     
29:32     
generates these forward and backward movements and it involves maybe about five or six cells and then you have the     
29:39     
sensory uh neurons that give a signal to those motor neurons that tell it where to move you know so you're moving     
29:45     
relative to some stimulus and then you have other cells that sort of mediate that process maybe     
29:53     
tune the movement and things like that so there there's a lot of you know connectomes are structured in in a lot     
29:59     
of interesting ways but um yeah then you know of course then we have the data for     
30:05     
larvel worms and I'm not really sure the state-ofthe-art there I'm sure there's     
30:10     
uh you know I know that there's a synaptic data set I know that people are working on looking at different     
30:17     
developmental stages uh you know there's a lot of work say for example on L1 arrest which is a     
30:23     
period where uh you can freeze celegans in this uh laral the first larval stage     
30:30     
and you can keep it there for like two or three weeks and uh you know you can look at like what's happening early on     
30:37     
um you basically uh you know you deprive it of food like when it's in its or you     
30:44     
actually hatch the eggs and then you deprive it of food and it can stay in that state for a long time uh but then     
30:50     
you also have the do uh stage which is from L2 to L4 and it's just an alternate     
30:58     
a version of development where you know it's it's got like these adaptations for     
31:04     
hunkering down in in adverse environmental conditions so it has a lot of adaptations there and so you know you     
31:10     
can study those variations on development with study development or laral development itself     
31:17     
so is there any because that was actually my first question in this uh RW     
31:23     
paper is there any uh specific points that would discriminate all these stages     
31:28     
from a behavior like Locomotion for example let we say uh L stage L1 L2 L3     
31:34     
L4 they are for example in in the in the average if sance is living for for     
31:40     
example 21 to 24 days I guess uh if the L one is for example if this is on I     
31:48     
guess uh it was day two or cha something like that uh do you have any specific     
31:54     
days for those larat for example L one to L2 is day for example uh two or     
32:03     
three to for example day seven or eight something like that yeah do we have uh     
32:08     
yeah I think that's such average models I think people characterize that you know I can I'll     
32:15     
show you in a little bit like what kinds of visualizations you can make for that and actually i' like to see a certain     
32:21     
type of visualization for that but we have to go into the literature and like find the sort of the consens timing for     
32:28     
this because it's like people kind of characterized it and you know but my main question is because if     
32:36     
for example we have L1 L2 something like that this is I guess this is something related to the size of the the C G but     
32:44     
is there any a specific Lage for for for its neural networks for example we could     
32:50     
say that like L1 that is happening when the size of the silon is 1/4 of     
32:58     
millimeter for example we have we have a similar lar     
33:03     
stage that's for example elbow something like that for its neural circuits that     
33:08     
looks like a toddler in for example in in humankind for example or have teenage     
33:15     
in humankind is is there something any specific timings for for for the for the     
33:22     
development of neur networks uh well I I think by the it hatches the I mean the neural network     
33:29     
doesn't work exactly the same way as human neural networks you it's largely     
33:35     
sort of fixed in the L1 you know so what you get in L1 is going to be what you     
33:41     
get in the adult in terms of neurons the conect the synaptic connections however are very plastic and you get differences     
33:48     
in the synaptic connections and that data set exist there are some data sets for that exist um I'll show you some I     
33:56     
did some experiments on that uh data set um then you know the L the developmental     
34:03     
stages refer to like a Mt of the cuticle and you know how it you know it     
34:08     
basically goes through these stages of growth um there's some interesting     
34:13     
things with like what they call seam cells so there's a postembryonic lineage tree that has like seam cells and these     
34:21     
are U uh you know different types of cells on the periphery of the seans I     
34:26     
don't know if there it can be explicitly connected to the connectone but there's there's     
34:32     
stuff going on there so there lot like a lot of different things uh that we can     
34:37     
tie to the connectome I don't know how much far we want to go out though um I     
34:42     
mean terms of the core connecto I think it's largely uh you know synaptic changes and     
34:48     
maybe some ION channel expression changes I know there's some gene expression data for larval stages as     
34:54     
well that might be interesting to see what's going on there that's a little bit harder to get at uh     
35:01     
than the uh the the actual connectivity map yeah but actually this is something     
35:08     
if you are going to understand how minds of the B works if you are going to understand how our brain works actually     
35:14     
this is the main question maybe lots of us are looking for to see how the minds of silons works because we we are more     
35:21     
interested in uh our intelligence than silon Swan but uh I'm saying     
35:27     
and as you know we are our aim somehow lots of our uh efforts here is to find     
35:35     
out those uh from a developmental point of view to understand how uh how good     
35:42     
all these put together and so educate uh maybe younger ones or even     
35:49     
ourselves that if a simple neural network is going to be uh studied like     
35:56     
this from for example how a learning how how     
36:01     
learning process happens during the development of seon like how     
36:07     
learning movement is happening inside a humankind this is maybe a little simpler     
36:14     
one so you could both understand with both understand that that process or     
36:20     
behavior as well as educate those who are interested in some simple uh model     
36:28     
FX Elegance to how it could be actually uh simulated like this for example a     
36:34     
neural network with lots of uh loads and connections could be so simple in a c g     
36:42     
with uh actually and the process of learning of The Locomotion of feeding Etc and this     
36:50     
is something uh with a big picture I have in mind in mind Plus uh to uh     
36:58     
understand as well that uh how maybe those processes is working in a real     
37:05     
life yeah so let me share my screen I'm going to go through some stuff that we've done um maybe some ways that we     
37:12     
can visualize this or get the data together in a more organized way     
37:20     
so okay here we go um     
37:25     
so     
37:30     
so this is worm book this is a good reference for looking at things all things sort of consensus on celegans so     
37:37     
they have some maps of laral develop or of uh embryogenetic development so this     
37:43     
is for epidermal and hypodermal morphogenesis so this is from worm book     
37:48     
this is figure one uh on the chapter on epidermal morphogenesis this is like a map of the     
37:56     
major events in morphogenesis so this is from the time that the uh this is around     
38:02     
the time that the embryo gets fertilized and St this is the first cleavage here     
38:09     
then there's the four cell stage notice that they have the time here in minutes so the forestell stage is 19 to 33     
38:15     
minutes after fertilization you have the founder cells generated which are those uh eight cells     
38:22     
that found the major lineages of seans so you get uh like uh three division events and     
38:30     
then you this happens just before 100 minutes so this actually this is uh I     
38:36     
think it's a 100 minutes right yeah this is uh so four cells happens at 19 to 33     
38:42     
minutes you get down to maybe 85 minutes and that's where your founder cells are generated and then you have uh the     
38:51     
ingression of e daughters which means they migrate around the E daughters are the anterior and     
38:57     
posterior oriented uh cells from the e- lineage this has to do with uh you know     
39:04     
tissue this is the beginnings of tissue formation uh then we have gastrulation which is 100 100 to 250 minutes so we     
39:12     
have that stage in there then we have the first cell death a little bit after 200 minutes so this is where some of the     
39:20     
developmental cells die and you see this in the lineage tree uh we have major major epidermal     
39:26     
cells born around 230 minutes the closure of the ventral CFT which is in     
39:32     
this area here the dorsal intercalation 290 to 340 minutes epidermal enclosure     
39:40     
350 to 390 minutes so you get these movements in the embryo then you get     
39:46     
elongation which is where you have this comma it looks like a comma which is     
39:51     
just kind of like the head and the tail starting to pull apart and form the long     
39:56     
worm that we know in the adult form and so the elongation goes from 395 to 520     
40:02     
minutes so we get this uh and then we get a bunch of other events fringo     
40:10     
glands fingio pumping at 760 minutes that's where we get this pumping of the     
40:15     
Fingal gland of the Fingal apparatus and so this is these are kind     
40:20     
of the first stirrings of behavior uh you know some of these are autonomous behaviors so you see a lot of muscle     
40:27     
twitching you see fingio pumping uh and they're kind of being oriented to the     
40:32     
nervous system at that point and then at 800 minutes which is do the math on that     
40:40     
um that's not you know it's like maybe a half a day you get hatch you get a hatch from the egg into this L1 stage and so     
40:48     
after this we get the L1 stage the L2 stage the L3 stage The L4 stage so my question is is it and     
40:56     
speciic time that for example the first Locomotion of the Silicon if you Tak for     
41:01     
example if in the for example in it starts from El Forest is yeah the first     
41:08     
movements uh it it starts late in in embryogenesis uh I I I'll show you     
41:13     
another figure where this is kind of put onto another timeline and we'll see what that looks like but it's you know this     
41:20     
is all taken from the literature so we have our knowledge of this is as good as the papers that are published     
41:27     
so like you know it's it's well characterized but I don't know if people have asked some specific questions uh     
41:33     
about movement like the generation of movement that that's something that you know it's like I don't know people have     
41:40     
asked exactly that question like when is the first uh like gold directed movement     
41:47     
versus the first sort of autonomous muscle twitch or autonomous foro pumping     
41:53     
so that's a question no one's really asked this is just from like different observations because I guess this is a     
42:00     
really important question if you are going to understand what is happening at     
42:06     
the first stage of uh a behavior like Locomotion and understand how a neural     
42:13     
circuit is going to be developed to uh to command Seance to move for the first     
42:20     
time uh how how it how it is actually is going to be uh     
42:26     
appear in in in the new networks of C from a developmental point of view this is my main questions that I have for for     
42:33     
a stud like this I'm trying to convey that what kind of questions and data I'm     
42:40     
looking for so this is this is exactly uh what I'm more interested in yeah so     
42:49     
then there's hypodermal morphogenesis which is this is a little bit less detailed this map but basically it goes     
42:57     
from Zer to 600 minutes and it just shows some of these things in the     
43:03     
microscopy so uh you know you get this basically these stages of development     
43:10     
and then they show some uh they show actually some neurons and their connections here so this is uh or I     
43:18     
guess not neurons but this is uh anyways this is a map of     
43:24     
hypodermal morphogen gen is so uh this this is another way to visualize this so you have these     
43:31     
different stages and you just mark them off and this is all from the literature from microscopy so the observations are     
43:38     
based you know based on what people have seen what they're looking for I don't know again like if there's something on     
43:44     
I don't even know if you know maybe it's more philosophical until you actually simulate it but to simulate it you need     
43:51     
to know kind of what what cells are there what kinds of different things are going on in in the late embryo and early     
43:59     
um laral stages uh so we have this     
44:04     
neuroinformatics paper uh this was published by you know this was published in the journal     
44:11     
neuroinformatics this is some work that we did on uh synthesizing early developmental     
44:17     
processes uh sort of in a computational way we've done this uh we've done this from uh primary data we've also done     
44:25     
this using machine learning in terms of extracting this out of uh cell images     
44:31     
but this is a graph where it shows the different types of adult cells that sort of emerge in the connectome over time so     
44:39     
you know you start with like at about 200 minutes of the first neurons you start to get different this is the     
44:45     
hypodermal neurons here this is il uh IL cells o     
44:51     
cells uh DV cells and so forth so this is kind of the emergence of these these different     
44:58     
cell classes and their number so you can see that you know you have this network     
45:04     
that changes its num its constituency and if you were to take a slice of time like at 220 minutes you     
45:12     
know you would have a network that was formed consists mostly of these H cells     
45:17     
and the uh hypodermal cells whereas later you would have you would include     
45:23     
other types of cells intestinal cells and so forth or in cells and so those would all kind of uh emerge over time so     
45:31     
if you want to build a a a make some sort of network of cells you would have     
45:37     
to sort of think about okay this is the type of cell that's here at this time in     
45:42     
development and so each cell type has certain properties certain gene expression profiles certain functions     
45:50     
and so you know it I don't know how useful that is for like a neural network but but it's definitely worth thinking     
45:57     
about how those and this happens in human connectomes as well that are you     
46:02     
know cell types especially over embryonic development they change their     
46:09     
constituency from like precursor cells to mature neurons and then we get this     
46:15     
added step in humans of having you know regulation by sort of being in a certain     
46:21     
Environ um you know cellular environment so sometimes neurons can change their     
46:28     
composition as they're near other neurons once they connect to each other they start to affect each other's gene     
46:34     
expression and so the the activity of the neurons changes depending on the parts the     
46:40     
constituents of their network but this is an important point that you have different cell types in biology you have     
46:48     
different fractions of cell type and that changes across uh development this is about you     
46:55     
know this is by like maybe mid embryogenesis from two to 300 minutes post     
47:01     
fertilization another figure we had from that paper was you know again taking like from 200 minutes to 300 minutes     
47:09     
looking at this all cells which are like all developmental cells and terminally     
47:15     
differentiated cells and then noticing that the number of terminally differentiated cells goes up from about     
47:22     
215 minutes to 300 minutes as a proportion of all cells so the blue here     
47:28     
this blue bar is basically uh all terminally differentiated cells plus uh     
47:36     
developmental cells so at 200 minutes everything is a developmental cell at 300 minutes this fraction of this blue     
47:44     
line of this Orange Line our terminal we differentiated cells and then the rest     
47:49     
are developmental cells as you notice the fraction of Developmental cells decreases because they're being     
47:55     
converted into terminally differentiated cells and then this one for B and I don't remember what the legend what the     
48:03     
difference is here but you get this I think this is the connectum this is overall you get this increase in     
48:09     
terminal we differentiated cells that's greater than in general in the embryo so     
48:15     
this is kind of an interesting point that you know you can look at that in terms of like you might in a neural     
48:22     
network you might have a cell that's very general in ter terms of its function or maybe it it's basically     
48:29     
nonfunctional but it's there so like you know you might in a neural network you might it might not have a it might be a     
48:35     
weightless entity so it's a unit that you just pass data through and you don't have any weight to it and then     
48:42     
eventually when it you know becomes terminally differentiated you might have a weight associated with that connection     
48:48     
you might also have some other specialized uh processing that goes on so it's important you know to have this     
48:55     
kind of a Time course think about how this process works one more question I'm going to cl     
49:02     
to clarify more the the the main point I'm going to start with uh     
49:10     
another example I could say for example during hatching as you said we know that     
49:15     
from a mechanical point of view if you are going to simulate something like that from a mechanical point of view the     
49:20     
hatching exactly takes place takes place where uh the pressure of the the volume     
49:29     
inside the egg is as much as actually is more than the stamina of     
49:38     
the uh the shell of the egg okay so when when the the body inside uh an egg is uh     
49:47     
is going to be to push uh that much pressure that could uh be defeated this     
49:55     
some enough the egg that the hatching is going to be play to actually to take place so this is the exact moment of the     
50:02     
hatching that could be for example as you said during the 300 minutes after or     
50:08     
600 minutes yeah 300 minutes for example after uh the the first     
50:14     
uh uh maybe proliferation so uh from that     
50:21     
point of view a mechanical model for movement for the first movement could be somehow when a seance is uh pulling or     
50:31     
pushing that much pressure to the to the ground uh underneath that could make it     
50:38     
the first movement uh actually there are usually pulses there are some as you     
50:44     
know there are some period periodic pulses inside the     
50:54     
neur is everyone else here still     
51:01     
here we lost the he for a minute here I'm still here okay yeah just just     
51:10     
just about to head out to take uh kids to school there     
51:15     
okay yeah I've been listening Bradley yeah     
51:22     
okay okay uh yeah so I don't when Ved will be back but yeah he had some an     
51:29     
interesting point which was that you have this biophysics of movement in sort     
51:35     
of hatching and so if we think about like what happens during hatching you     
51:40     
know the the the SE aligan embryo is rolled up basically at that point so we     
51:46     
have like a basically it's it's reaching it's sort of like it's sort of like this where     
51:53     
it's like rolled up it's almost like a SP roll it's inside the     
51:59     
egg and then it breaks open and then once the eggshell breaks     
52:04     
open you get this unfurling of the worm so it unfurls and then it starts to move around so this whole thing is kind of     
52:11     
from these embryogenetic movements and then it elongates but it elongates in the spiral and then that spiral kind of     
52:18     
breaks free once the egg is hatched so there are a bunch of movements there so     
52:23     
you know there's a hatching physics and I don't know if people have characterized this it may not be     
52:29     
characterized very well there's also sort of the unfurling physics so there's a sort of a and I     
52:37     
don't know if this is like a a set of sort of you know reactive behaviors or if     
52:44     
there's like if the worm is actually trying to actively do this with its     
52:49     
nervous system which like it might move with the movement circuit but this is stuff that we can find in the literature     
52:56     
if we uh you know are so inclined to go in that     
53:01     
direction um yeah I don't think he's back yet so yeah he brought some     
53:06     
interesting points uh I have a couple other the other paper that I wanted to     
53:11     
go over with some of the figures is this Frontiers paper so this was something I     
53:16     
published on my own this is raising the connectto and it really kind of took a     
53:22     
lot of things out of the literature to put together a model of uh okay so that's that     
53:28     
figure a model of sort of uh movement behaviors and you know how that fits     
53:34     
into the embryogenetic development uh framework so you have this this is     
53:40     
something from that paper it's a timeline where you have fertilization at Time Zero the first terminal we     
53:46     
differentiated cells at 200 minutes and then this NS y5 sub Network which is     
53:53     
part of the movement Network the first cells appear around 270     
53:58     
minutes uh you have the comma stage you have the emergence of asymmetric gene     
54:03     
expression and axonal outgrowth so this is where we begin to have cells send axons out to to make connections with     
54:11     
each other you have the initiation of the twitching phase which is where you get these autonomous twitching movements     
54:18     
so this happens around 450 to 470 minutes you get ference morphogenesis     
54:25     
from 430 minutes to 760 minutes so this is the site of the first pumping so this     
54:31     
this begins kind of when we start to see aono Wild growth and this autonomous     
54:37     
twitching and then at 770 minutes this gets put together at least in the Fingal     
54:43     
sub network of the connectone and it it results in the efficient sort of     
54:48     
efficient Fingal pumping so you know you can think of a lot of these twitching behaviors as maybe non gold directed or     
54:55     
non non-efficient it could you know like I can move my finger by it a muscle     
55:02     
twitch but it's not an efficient movement it doesn't do anything that I want it to it just Twitches so you know     
55:09     
that's that's kind of the you know you're moving from this sort of movement generation to some directed set of     
55:16     
movements that do something functional and then this is right before hatch so     
55:21     
we have some of this outline and this is basically from the literature so you know the idea would be to kind of think     
55:27     
about from about 450 minutes of embryogenesis down to 770 minutes that's     
55:34     
really where you get this you can you have a case study there of like Fingal pumping and how this starts to go from     
55:43     
being kind of a randomly generated set of movements to something     
55:49     
coordinated um then there are these other so this is again proportion     
55:55     
developmental cells we saw that before and then this this is actually a map of     
56:00     
this uh synaptic data set in uh larvel development so this is uh     
56:07     
available uh on I have access to it you know we can go through that data set but     
56:13     
basically it's the plasticity of synapses in larval development so you     
56:19     
get the you can actually go down to the birth time uh and you can look at the average number of synap say you can     
56:25     
actually look at this also over laral development and see what the changes look like uh this is with the the data     
56:33     
set that I'm working from has three classes we have transient synapses we     
56:40     
have developmental synapses and then we have stable synapses so the transient ones kind of get rewired throughout     
56:47     
development so you get like a transient uh synapse is something that is active     
56:53     
only for a little while and then goes away and so you see a lot of those in certain part points in     
56:59     
development uh it doesn't really tell you why they're transient it's just that they're they don't persist you get     
57:07     
developmental uh synapses which are only really developmentally you know if you looked at the adult conecto these     
57:15     
synapses wouldn't exist but they have developmental roles or they're in they're there during development and     
57:21     
then the stable ones are those that are like Main Ain long term so you might be able to find their analoges in in the     
57:28     
adult worm and so there are these three different uh stages and again without     
57:35     
going back to the paper you know you can do these kind of analyses and look at specific you know maybe like the motor     
57:42     
circuit and see what's going on there we didn't do that analysis for this paper but those data exist     
57:50     
um and so yeah it's it's definitely something that would be interesting to     
57:56     
look into later as a thing that um you know would be sort of the basis for this     
58:02     
so this yeah this is the figure here so uh these are actually I guess     
58:12     
uh okay these are press synaptic and post synaptic so in a nervous system you     
58:18     
have synapses that are connections that are press synaptic leading into the neuron then post synaptic leading out so     
58:24     
there that's what the differences are here and so you know we can look at that we can look at the timing of these we     
58:30     
can look at their sort of if they're transient developmental or stable so um     
58:40     
yeah okay ved's back are you veed yeah     
58:47     
hell lost over here for some uh Second     
58:52     
and then came back yeah     
58:59     
no okay I guess I I I could conve what what I meant by the first big Bank of     
59:09     
you can say the movement of this is uh uh from I was talking about the     
59:16     
mechanical uh simulation of of such the first movement like the     
59:22     
hatching yeah this similar one but as we know there are uh circular or regular     
59:31     
periodic polies inside seon neural network which is actually at the end uh     
59:39     
goes to to the muscle cells and uh and     
59:44     
they could be def final a so uh my question is that if there is     
59:52     
uh if there is if could be a model that could simulate whenever those impulses     
1:00:00     
are making enough uh and and the maybe the the the muscle cells are as as act     
1:00:10     
are uh are strong enough that the incoming pulses could make uh some     
1:00:18     
cells uh uh pushing uh next them to push enough forces and on     
1:00:25     
uh on the Underground surface for example it is on on the earth how much     
1:00:33     
pressure how much pressure could be that uh that force and gravity underneath     
1:00:40     
that could make the first movement with some angle to say so if if we could     
1:00:46     
calculate something like that we could uh uh we could maybe go to the point     
1:00:53     
that the first movement of Ste is somehow is taking place this is a     
1:00:59     
simulation point of view a mechanical simulation point of view for for that type of Developmental Stace so I'm more     
1:01:06     
looking specifically to model something like this yeah yeah yeah I mean that     
1:01:13     
that would be uh you know we have to kind of figure out from the literature     
1:01:18     
where the uh you know different things you know what those things are what the     
1:01:25     
parameters are maybe um you could also estimate that it is possible to estimate     
1:01:32     
something like this because we have the model for an adult so if we could estimate that how much force could be     
1:01:39     
enough to make the first push that maybe yeah maybe the first uh the first     
1:01:46     
estimation of the uh the needed size of muscles for example or something like     
1:01:52     
that like how much muscle pressure would you need or how much muscle force would you need and when would you need it like     
1:01:58     
would you need to do it repeatedly or whatever yeah that'd be kind of     
1:02:05     
interesting um yeah so I wanted to one last word about the timeline so     
1:02:11     
basically if we look at development we have or larvel development we have four     
1:02:17     
stages we have this L1 L2 L3 and L4 this is the adult     
1:02:24     
and then there you know the differences in the adult they're all younger adults and older adults and uh I've also looked     
1:02:32     
at sort of reproductively with these you know sort differences in the adult stage     
1:02:37     
so the hermaphrodites which are 99% of the worms are laying eggs they lay their     
1:02:44     
eggs in clutches so they have like they weay their eggs and then they stop laying eggs and then they become sort of     
1:02:50     
ccent worms and then die you know like that they die after maybe 3 to four days     
1:02:57     
sometimes longer depending on what happens in the developmental stages here but basically you know for L1 we have     
1:03:04     
this L1 arrest and that's where we just arrest we can starve the eggs and we can let     
1:03:12     
the eggs hatch and then they survive and they persist in an L1 stage for like two     
1:03:18     
weeks um and then you can like measure what happens after they've had that that     
1:03:23     
starvation experience basically there's some plasticity maybe associated with that not necessarily phenotypic but like     
1:03:30     
in gene expression and things like that it's well known that there's some met metabolic genes that go up and down as     
1:03:37     
you uh depending on what Gene you're talking about at L2 to L4 we have this do stage     
1:03:44     
which is where we have these protective uh protective uh this     
1:03:49     
protective plasticity that occurs in response to extreme environmental conditions     
1:03:54     
you can think of this as like diapause and then you have uh these seam cells that are born so you have     
1:04:04     
postembryonic uh you have a post embrionic lineage tree where these seam cells are born and that post embrionic     
1:04:11     
lineage tree was also done by um you know by the same group that did the     
1:04:17     
embryonic Lage tree so theyve kind of fit that in so you can actually get that information so you know terms of like     
1:04:24     
laral development we have a lot of available information we have     
1:04:29     
timing we have like uh you know cell sort of cell     
1:04:35     
State information we have information about     
1:04:41     
synapses and you know we I don't know how much biophysics we have here um there's certainly a lot of     
1:04:46     
characterization of Da worms L1 AR rest you know seam cell     
1:04:52     
morphogenesis so we have a a lot of things here maybe there's some uh     
1:04:58     
studies on like sort of the mechanics of movement throughout the laral Worm but     
1:05:04     
we can also do the reverse engineering aspect where we look at the adult maybe the young adult and we kind of map that     
1:05:11     
back to what's going on in the larel stages because the larel stages are just differentiated largely by different     
1:05:18     
molts of the cuticle so like as it grows it sheds its cuticle it builds a new one     
1:05:24     
and then you get this if you eventually get to adulthood so that's I mean that's     
1:05:29     
a kind of diagram we maybe you'd like to have sort of like this time course to populate it with different things that     
1:05:36     
we know are going on different data sets and then say okay we can take the data that we have and you know simulate these     
1:05:43     
different points in time so we might set up a simulation for L1 L2 L3 L4 and then     
1:05:51     
young adult or maybe even one we could simulate like prehatch uh stuff going on like right     
1:05:59     
before hatch and compare it with L1 so there a lot of ways you can set that up     
1:06:04     
and like make those     
1:06:19     
comparisons so yeah have a he any words about any of that     
1:06:27     
yeah thank you I was actually uh making some notes inside the paper what we are     
1:06:32     
discussing so uh those M I'm trying to uh make specify that what are those M     
1:06:41     
that we are looking for for some simulation like that I was taking some     
1:06:46     
notes completing the questions that I've been listed in the graph model so that     
1:06:52     
it could continue as we uh moving on okay that sounds great yeah     
1:06:59     
I looking forward to seeing it develop the drift     
1:07:05     
thank and uh and any type of uh a suggestion uh I would be very happy     
1:07:14     
if you and or anyone else has any type of suggestion or preferences to recommend for uh adding to those uh     
1:07:24     
and to trying to extract data from those refences would be     
1:07:30     
appreciated yeah that would be     
1:07:36     
great all right so uh well did anyone else have anything they want to share     
1:07:46     
uh I don't know if Dick had anything he wanted to mention before we go oh no     
1:07:53     
okay thanks all right so well thank you for attending um that was a great overview     
1:08:00     
by a heat of some emerging work and you know we'll keep working on that um     
1:08:07     
otherwise have a good week thank you bye all right now I'd like to talk     
1:08:12     
about a paper that has particular relevance to some of the work on expansion and contraction waves as a     
1:08:20     
collective phenomena we call differentiation waves so this is something that Richard Gordon     
1:08:26     
has has spent his whole career kind of uh reinterpreting from the uh     
1:08:32     
developmental biology literature and this is uh I think it's     
1:08:37     
very informative also to some of the biophysics work we've been talking about so this paper is called spatial     
1:08:43     
constraints control cell proliferation and tissues uh looks like it's a German     
1:08:48     
group maybe with some people at Stanford U people at Santa Barbara The caval     
1:08:54     
Institute for theoretical physics and you know kind of goes over this idea that cell proliferation is     
1:09:01     
sort of the key to developing tissues so if we go into the water AR differentiation waves we have expansion     
1:09:09     
waves and contraction waves expansion waves are waves of activity cells will     
1:09:15     
increase their proliferative capacity those cells will start to reproduce more     
1:09:20     
and more and so you get a whole area of the embryo that has more and more cells     
1:09:26     
maybe of a certain type and you end up with the differentiation of a tissue     
1:09:31     
conversely you can have contraction waves which are where there's a signal that goes across the number of cells and     
1:09:38     
it slows down their proliferation rate so it has to do with cell cycle it has to do with the control of cell division     
1:09:45     
and so we have this question of cell proliferation in the embryo and what's controlling that and what are the     
1:09:52     
patterns of cell proliferation ation in space so this paper is very relevant to that set of     
1:09:58     
questions and so when we read the abstract and go through the paper and see what kind of insights we can find so     
1:10:04     
the abstract reads control of cell proliferation is a fundamental aspect of tissue formation in development and     
1:10:11     
regeneration cells experience various spatial mechanical constraints depending on their environmental context in the     
1:10:18     
body but we do not fully understand if and how such constraints influence cell     
1:10:24     
progression and they are proliferation patterns and tissues so let's think about this in terms of our     
1:10:30     
differentiation waves and the different types of waves we can have so let's have an embryo here with a bunch of     
1:10:37     
cells those cells divide from their mother cells so we have a     
1:10:44     
bunch of daughter cells here and the cells communicate across space so one cell can communicate with     
1:10:51     
other cells and so forth so we can have these waves of activity indeed we have     
1:10:57     
waves of activity throughout embryogenesis sometimes they're calcium waves sometimes they're chemical waves     
1:11:04     
sometimes they're other types of waves and so you can interpret these waves as having sort of a control over cell     
1:11:11     
proliferation or cell division so as these cells divide they do so with a     
1:11:17     
certain rate and we can sort of figure out that rate and figure out the     
1:11:23     
differences in that rate over time and in different locations of the embryo so for example say there's a wave     
1:11:30     
that continues throughout this part of the embryo and that wave has an effect on     
1:11:37     
the cells in that region that they slow down their uh proliferation rate so this     
1:11:45     
region has slower proliferation than this region that leads to some sort of     
1:11:50     
differentiation between the two regions this inner region and this outer     
1:11:56     
region and you get some sort of differentiation event and it forms a tissue distinct     
1:12:03     
tissue so it looks different sometimes it behaves different and that's sort of the logic behind differentiation waves     
1:12:11     
this rate then will become important in this paper as well because what they're saying is that they spatial constraints     
1:12:17     
on proliferation rate so they're actually looking at you know the spatiality of the embryo     
1:12:24     
it may be some constraints so for example migration patterns of cells or     
1:12:29     
the number of existing cells in certain locations the regions that uh you know     
1:12:37     
demarcate the embryo so their previous differentiation events and so forth so     
1:12:43     
here we study the impact of mechanical manipulations on the cell cycle of individual cells within a Aon model     
1:12:50     
epithelium by monitoring the response to experimentally applied forces we find a checkpoint at the G1 s boundary that in     
1:12:58     
response to spatial constraints controls cell cycle progression they mean by checkpoint at the g1s     
1:13:05     
boundary is that they have this model of cell cycle and cell cycle has a number of phases they have a certain     
1:13:12     
nomenclature for that some of the one phase is G1 and another phase is s and     
1:13:18     
so cell cyer progression happens by these different phases becoming in sync     
1:13:23     
or out of syn in other words if you if you expend that phase or Shrink that     
1:13:29     
phase you can affect what happens to the cell how fast it     
1:13:34     
proliferates but also if it goes through apotosis or you know other things that     
1:13:40     
can happen to the cell and cell cycle a lot of things are cell cycle mediated cancer is cell cycle mediated to an     
1:13:48     
extent uh differentiation cellular reprogramming Etc     
1:13:55     
they're what they're doing here is they're experimental way applying forces and they're getting a systemic response     
1:14:01     
in the cell cycle genes so there are a whole bunch of genes that control the the sort of the duration of each part of     
1:14:08     
cell cycle and the transition from one cell cycle phase to another we have     
1:14:13     
these checkpoints which are points at which there's some sort of input is to tell the cell whether to move to the     
1:14:20     
next phase or not so that's what they mean by checkpoint so we find a checkpoint at the g1s phase     
1:14:28     
boundary that in response to spatial constraints so these are spatial     
1:14:33     
constraints in the embryo like we showed here and remember there are all sorts of forces acting on each cell so the cell     
1:14:41     
could have some sort of be in some sort of force regime or some sort of environmental situation where it needs     
1:14:48     
to divide faster or divide slower so there are all sorts of mechanical cues that are playing a role Ro in shaping     
1:14:56     
this wave and the extent of the influence of this wave and the extent of the influence of any one set of uh devel     
1:15:05     
division conditions or or proliferation conditions this checkpoint prevents     
1:15:11     
cells from entering s-phase if the available space remains below a characteristic threshold because of     
1:15:18     
crowding so what they mean by that is that if there's crowding in the embryo     
1:15:25     
so if there are too many cells in a certain region and there's a mechanical signal     
1:15:32     
that says we're crowded we're all full then that will send a signal back     
1:15:37     
to the cell and tell it to not enter that phase of cell     
1:15:43     
division and thus slowing the rate of proliferation and this happens across     
1:15:48     
allll cells so if there's crowding we've talked about jamming phase transitions where you get you go from having like     
1:15:56     
massive proliferation to this sort of jammed phase and this happens in     
1:16:01     
development a number of times the basically this is describing     
1:16:07     
that mechanism for how that works there's also unjamming which is interesting and that can happen either     
1:16:13     
due to migration or maybe due to this proliferation signal this checkpoint prevents cells from entering s-phase so     
1:16:20     
s-phase is being mediated by these forces which isn't further mediated by sort of C uh sort of density conditions     
1:16:28     
and maybe some other Force conditions as well stretching the tissue results in fast cell cycle reactivation whereas     
1:16:35     
compression rapidly leads to cell cycle rest so basically if you have a tissue     
1:16:40     
with cells and you stretch that uh tissue so if you stretch this tissue on the inside     
1:16:48     
outward you give it a little bit more space     
1:16:54     
so this little area here get stretched     
1:17:00     
outward you're essentially expanding the area which it has to divide and     
1:17:08     
proliferate this can uh result in fast cell cycle reactivation so cell cycle is     
1:17:13     
reactivated and it makes sense because if you release you relieve the pressure on these cells they can start to     
1:17:20     
proliferate again and fill that space whereas compression rapidly leads     
1:17:27     
a cell cycle AR rest so if you compress the space even further I have my cells here and I'm     
1:17:36     
compressing the available space or you know if it's going to     
1:17:41     
really crowd them in even more confined area and so that     
1:17:46     
leads to a rest and we know that you know there are all sorts of horse cues     
1:17:51     
and signals that are happening so they happen at each cell but they happen across an entire population of cells so     
1:17:58     
a coordin it gets coordinated just by being a global signal our kinetic analysis of this     
1:18:06     
response shows that cells of no memory of past constraints and allows us to form AA biophysical model that predicts     
1:18:12     
tissue growth in response to changes and spatial constraints in the environment so it doesn't have a memory     
1:18:19     
of what you know what what sorts of force it's encountered it's just     
1:18:25     
basically a very expedient response so what happens in in uh response to a     
1:18:32     
single set of environmental conditions and it doesn't really influence what happens after that so you     
1:18:38     
know if we think about our model of uh differentiation waves you know we think about how this can happen in different     
1:18:45     
ways in different parts of the embryo and it could even happen you know across species if you have changes to the     
1:18:52     
embryo you can have different types of tissue form based on those expansion and contraction waves this characteristic     
1:18:59     
biomechanical cell cycle response likely serves as a fundamental control mechanism to maintain tissue integrity     
1:19:05     
and ensure control of tissue growth during development and regeneration what they talk about here is they give the     
1:19:11     
example of yeast uh saccaromyces where cell division is linked to cell     
1:19:17     
growth through a size checkpoint during late G1 phase and so this is again this these phases of cell division     
1:19:23     
there's a checkpoint known in sacr myces during L G1 phase that links cell     
1:19:29     
division to cell growth so in other words in yeast as the cell size grows     
1:19:34     
there's a there's a sort of a signal that gets picked up at this checkpoint     
1:19:40     
in late G1 phase this is right before S phase that tells it either to divide or not to divide so it's a very simple uh     
1:19:47     
signal in a very simple system you don't have a lot of cells interacting in an     
1:19:53     
embryo in this case you just have cells that you know either get big and divide     
1:20:00     
and then they live in these colonies and it's it's a different world for     
1:20:05     
them this size checkpoint terms start in yeast is believed to ensure that only     
1:20:10     
cells that have reached a characteristic size enter the cell cycle is therefore critical for cell size     
1:20:17     
homeostasis so again in East you have this model where if the cell reaches a     
1:20:22     
certain size size it divides if it doesn't it doesn't divide and it just basically regulates the size of each     
1:20:28     
cell in that in that colony and so you know you have this uh size regulation     
1:20:34     
and this self size homeostasis however it is not known how cells monitor their own size so we don't     
1:20:41     
know what the mechanism is for this we only know that it exists that there's this cell cycle sort of Regulation     
1:20:48     
there's the cell cycle regulation based on cell size and we don't we know it's probably not actively measuring its cell     
1:20:54     
size uh in in in the way that you might think it's just that maybe when it reaches a certain you know there's some     
1:21:02     
CU that gets sent back to the uh cell cycle that tells it to either divide or     
1:21:07     
not to divide it could just simply be that you know there there's a pretty characteristic growth rate for cells and     
1:21:13     
so it operates within that regime with a little bit of noise and there maybe     
1:21:18     
isn't really an explicit signal and it results in homeostasis but in this case we don't really know how cells monitor     
1:21:25     
the real size we don't know what kinds of cues are available the situation is even less     
1:21:31     
clear in M Alan cells although early studies and cultured cells argued for a size     
1:21:36     
checkpoint similar to that of yeast more recent reports instead propose the growth rate is a trigger for cell     
1:21:42     
division in this view reaching a characteristic growth rate rather than a characteristic size triggers entry into     
1:21:49     
SASE so growth rate of course is a derivative of size if you think about it as sort of a     
1:21:56     
continuous phenomenon so let's map out what we have here so we have G1 phase     
1:22:02     
and we have S phase G1 and s in yeast we know that there is this     
1:22:08     
checkpoint and it's based on cell size and then in mammals we know that     
1:22:16     
there's sort of a I wouldn't say it's a similar checkpoint but it's based on     
1:22:21     
rate so in both cases you have this basically yes or no     
1:22:29     
signal kind of like a switch or it says it's a simple signal it says should you     
1:22:34     
enter S phase or not so the idea is that it enters SASE either it enters SASE and     
1:22:41     
S phase begins or G1 continues and S phase is not entered so this has consequences for     
1:22:47     
division and then thus it controls the rate of proliferation so we know that     
1:22:53     
you know growth rate is a little bit different than size size is just you know either knowing what the size is or     
1:23:00     
you know having some signal that kind of is a proxy for size or just having a deterministic signal with some noise     
1:23:07     
that matches the growth to a certain size it could be a timer or whatever in Maman     
1:23:14     
cells there has to be a little bit more complex of a signal because it's dealing with growth rate which is possible if     
1:23:21     
you get signals from from other cells in the embryo and know what you know what their position is what their size is or     
1:23:28     
so and so forth the body of animals largely comprises cohesive tissues in which     
1:23:34     
cells are not in isolation but coupled mechanically through cell cell and cell substr contact so we know that from our     
1:23:40     
original model here of the embryo we have all these cells that are dividing     
1:23:46     
but they're in this substrate or in this in this uh Matrix where they can     
1:23:52     
communic Comm unicate with each other and where they kind of have you know cues like density and and chemical cues     
1:23:58     
like that so so we have these very basic cues that can be used uh by the cells     
1:24:05     
spatial constraints from crowding for example limitations on available space due to the presence of neighboring cells     
1:24:12     
impose constraints on Cell functions such as cell proliferation so this is a tissue level     
1:24:17     
feedback perhaps uh and they call this a spatial constraint     
1:24:23     
so they did some live Imaging of cell cycle state of individual cells and these a model     
1:24:30     
epithelium and then they introduced some experimental perturbations and look at the     
1:24:36     
results uh so they either acutely removed a barrier to release spatial constraints at the edge of the model     
1:24:43     
epithelium or prefer mechanical stretching or compression of the tissue substrate and manipulate spatial     
1:24:49     
constraints directly so again they did these stretching and compression experiments like we saw in this example     
1:24:57     
here where you either push the cells Inward and reduce their total volume     
1:25:02     
that they can proliferate in or you expand that volume and let them freely proliferate without any constraints     
1:25:08     
since we're isolating the cues that they're using through modifying the sort of space that they have we show that     
1:25:15     
proliferation rate in tissues is controlled by a mechanosensitive cell cycle checkpoint the monitors the space     
1:25:20     
available to the cell at the g1s interface so if we go back to our g1s     
1:25:26     
interface you monitor the available space around the cell and that is sort     
1:25:32     
of a proxy for growth rate because if you have a higher growth rate then there are more cells around you there's a     
1:25:39     
higher density of cells if and that could be a chemical signal being emanated from the cells and there could     
1:25:45     
be like you know some sort of summation or integration of the signals or you     
1:25:50     
know just simply knowing that like they different uh other types of signals you     
1:25:55     
can use like mechanical strain or whatever in the environment so if you     
1:26:00     
have a dense packing of cells for example there's a mechanical strain associated with that there's a loose     
1:26:06     
packing of cells you have a mechanical signal related to that and so you know     
1:26:12     
Susan's work I think is key here because it gives us this sort of um it     
1:26:17     
characterizes the mechanical environment using mathematical modeling we can predict the tissue response changes in     
1:26:23     
spatial constraints and validate the prediction of the model that cell division is required for sustained     
1:26:28     
invasion of a tissue into newly colonized spaces so they grew an epithelial model tissue consisting of     
1:26:35     
contact inhibited fully polarized maen Derby canine kidney 2 cells against     
1:26:41     
their removable barrier and so they were able to use this removable barrier to do some of the experiments to monitor cell     
1:26:48     
cycle Dynamics we used a fluorescent ubiquination based cell cycle indicator after barrier removal the     
1:26:55     
tissue rapidly invaded the available space and after slight away cells behind the initial barrier also reactivated     
1:27:02     
their cell cycle by entering s-phase so it's all about entering s-phase that's the thing that creates this the     
1:27:08     
conditions for proliferation and the more you can delay S phase the more you can pull back or uh     
1:27:17     
stop proliferation and the sooner you enter S phase the faster you can pull effort and     
1:27:24     
so this is what they're observing here this was accompanied by a noted increase in the space covered by individual cells     
1:27:31     
the cross-sectional cell area called cell area from the edge of the tissue reaching into the tissue interestingly     
1:27:38     
cells entering s-phase they entered s-phase in all regions of increased cell area up to several hundred micrometers     
1:27:45     
behind the initial barrier whereas cells even further behind remained at a high density and did not exhibit signs of     
1:27:52     
increased proliferation so this is figure a it kind of shows the cell cycle so you have cells in sg2 M phase in     
1:28:00     
green cells in G G1 phase cells in g1s Phase interface and so you have these     
1:28:06     
different phases of cell cycle you have S G2 M g0 G1 and then s again it goes     
1:28:13     
around in a circle and the idea is that you have cells in different states you know you want to synchronize your cells     
1:28:20     
at the beginning of an experiment but they go through all these stages and so to capture them at this g1s interface     
1:28:26     
and then do the experiments there and focus on that part of cell cycle you can     
1:28:32     
then see what the collective effects because you want them all synchronized so that you can have the collective     
1:28:37     
effects of this phenomena to see what's going on that's that's that's what we're     
1:28:42     
trying to do here interestingly in tissues you know cell cycle may or may not be synchronized so you have cells in     
1:28:49     
all different phases of cell cycle and the question is is that if they're not synchronized in in the bio in the body     
1:28:58     
and we do this in culture we can see a very clear signal in culture but in the body it might actually be a little bit     
1:29:04     
less uh coordinated but nevertheless we see coordinated movements so we can assume that there's something going this     
1:29:11     
is a this is a good model to use uh so they basically have this     
1:29:16     
barrier this pdms barrier it's type of material type of uh plastic and then     
1:29:22     
they remove the barrier so they they pack the cells in they sort of constrain them and then they give them free space     
1:29:29     
and then the opposite is true they move the PDS barrier backwards and they con strain the cell and so they're actually     
1:29:35     
able to do cell tracking here over time so they can actually get position State and area of cross-section this is how     
1:29:42     
they do their measurements they do this using microscopy and then they show this     
1:29:47     
invasion of the cells when the barriers removed so as the bar this pdms barrier     
1:29:53     
is removed it opens up all this free space in black and so you can see the invasion over 30 and 60 hours this is     
1:30:00     
basically cell proliferation you see the green dots in here which are the proliferating cells and that's their uh     
1:30:07     
signal for proliferation so you can see that there's some green spots over here but mostly on the on the on the frontier     
1:30:15     
and we can see here in this graph G that in the g0 G1 phase cell area increased     
1:30:22     
es almost linearly maybe a little bit higher than linear and then it reaches     
1:30:27     
the S boundary where the cell area sort of uh it enters a logarithmic phase and     
1:30:34     
it's pretty stable so what's happening here is in g0 G1 the cell size is increasing and the cell area is     
1:30:41     
increasing I guess and then as it reaches that S phase they start to     
1:30:46     
divide and so they have a much more regular size after that and they're able to put all that extra growth into     
1:30:54     
proliferation instead of cell size growth and so we have our external mechanical perturbation here in a we     
1:31:00     
have external forces being applied and we see that then there's a relaxed substrate and then we apply external     
1:31:07     
forces so we can see that some of these perturbations there's some adaptation here we have cell cycle arrest and we     
1:31:15     
have the initial application of external forces then we relax the substrate and     
1:31:20     
then we have cell cycro compression afterwards so again we have this when we     
1:31:26     
compress the substrate we have cell cycle arrest when we relax the substrate we have cell cycle progression so this     
1:31:33     
is what we were talking about in terms of triggering these changes in cell in     
1:31:39     
in how cells how we enter us phase and so we can actually do this with fmac olical cell cycle inhibition so we can     
1:31:46     
look at the relaxed substrate if we inhibit cell cycle before s-phase entrance even even if we have a relaxed     
1:31:52     
substrate we don't do not see proliferation of cells if we     
1:31:58     
pharmacologically inhibit s-phase uh on a stretch surface which is     
1:32:03     
of course a different type of substrate we still get no celf proliferation we     
1:32:09     
get green we get proliferative conditions when we have we release that     
1:32:15     
pharmacological intervention we get either a stretch substrate or a relaxed substrate we in     
1:32:22     
both cases we get this increased proliferation so I hope you learned something from that paper and hopefully     
1:32:28     
we can apply it to some of our own work in the group thank you
