## TRANSCRIPT

0:00     
hi oh hi how are you oh hi I'm glad I could actually join the meeting oh why     
0:10     
oh I'm in DC oh okay oh yeah yeah yeah     
0:15     
it looks like you're in a different place so yeah there's     
0:23     
so a blanket behind me that belongs to my grandson oh okay     
0:30     
all right     
0:38     
Morgan     
0:46     
Morgan all right uh so we have any updates before we get     
0:54     
started updates um I'm still I'm trying to     
1:00     
validate my um model with real world     
1:06     
measurements okay yeah so I'm I was told     
1:11     
to use engineering strain which is the area that you start     
1:18     
with and just use that as your area to figure out your     
1:26     
stress yeah uh it's changes so if I want true     
1:32     
stress then I have to measure the area of the whole thing as I     
1:38     
go I might be able to     
1:44     
like but anyways uh I'm getting MEAP pascals which     
1:50     
is for um 100 Nano Newtons of pressure     
1:56     
of force so that's in line with uh some tissue measurements like it it's in the     
2:04     
ballpark because I have a a graph of various tissues and and they're in the     
2:09     
mega Pascal so yeah so that's good yeah not totally out     
2:18     
to lunch anyway yeah so that's that's my     
2:24     
update I haven't got as much done as I was I would like because I've been traveling     
2:32     
right that's good yeah that's great     
2:38     
okay well when don't we get started uh welcome to the meeting um yeah kind of     
2:46     
this post Google summer of code period where people are less uh enthusiastic or     
2:53     
active I don't know uh but yeah so yeah this is uh the day that they release the     
3:00     
Nobel prizes for physiology and medicine on Monday oh wow and I'll talk about     
3:07     
that and then I'll talk maybe about another paper as well so it's kind of     
3:12     
like last week where we remember the papers yeah I was on the road last week     
3:19     
yeah yeah so I yeah I also in one of those well in kind of uniting both of     
3:27     
those papers I kind of came up with this idea of looking at uh biochemical reactions     
3:36     
in eoli and how those are used to uh govern Locomotion with their fella     
3:45     
rotor and with simple nervous systems where you have a sensor and an affector     
3:52     
joined by an intr nerve so was looking as considering that but that's something     
3:57     
that is Maybe uh interesting for followup uh we'll see how that     
4:06     
goes um so that's so today was the Nobel Prize in physiology and     
4:12     
medicine and this is the uh press release so who got the Nobel Prize this     
4:18     
week or this year for 2024 and the prize goes the Victor     
4:25     
Ambrose and Gary R and this is for the discovery micr RNA     
4:30     
and its role in posttranscriptional gene regulation so to recap you know we have     
4:36     
genes and they get transcribed they produce mrnas or messenger rnas these messenger rnas are     
4:45     
pro basically transcribed from the gene in the DNA and those uh mrnas can be     
4:54     
transcribed in different ways and that's governed by the sort of     
5:00     
the transcriptional start site and the transcriptional end site and you know     
5:06     
there's like the promoter region and then they're also these     
5:12     
regulatory uh rnas that play a role in regulating how that transcript is     
5:19     
produced so there's a whole literature on this and it's you know pretty messy     
5:25     
people have we'll talk about a little bit about this later but basically in     
5:31     
seans and this is uh the work of Gary Roven and his     
5:37     
group um it's basically talking about uh you know they've been able to find they     
5:43     
were able to figure out how micro worked at the level of a single Gene and a     
5:50     
single micro that's responsible for something in the Gene and then show that relationship so that's you know one     
5:57     
examp really good example of how it works so this year's Nobel Prize it     
6:02     
honors these two scientists and they kind of made their discoveries in Tandem     
6:08     
and this was you know back in the 90s so this was like you know it takes a while for Nobel prizes to matriculate down to     
6:15     
something that's um you know prize worthy so they talk about a little bit     
6:22     
of Preamble here uh and they talk about this is an a     
6:28     
diagram of the human you know like a human cell the human genome they show it     
6:34     
in the nucleus here this nuclear DNA Human Genome contains around 20,000     
6:40     
genes and then they get this the DNA is here and they have this old diagram of a single Gene transcription into mRNA     
6:48     
translation into protein and then that determines cell type that's the way they have it in this diagram and so you know     
6:56     
one of the things about transcription is you have these post transcriptional modifications that produce different     
7:03     
types of mrnas so you have all sorts of different types of rnas that do that micro rnas     
7:10     
and other things that you know there're all sorts of different rnas that have different uh you know nomenclatures and     
7:18     
things like that basically there are a host of things that will do this job um     
7:24     
you know and and so there posttranscriptional modifications they also postr ational     
7:30     
modifications which occur you know after translation has occurred or during     
7:35     
translation so when the MRNA reaches the ribosome and it's turned into amino acids or it's translated into amino     
7:43     
acids then those modifications occur there as well so the protein is the product of posttranscriptional post     
7:50     
transational mechanisms so and and micr being one of those post transcriptional     
7:57     
mechanisms so uh they in this 1960s it was shown that specialized proteins     
8:04     
known as transcription factors combin to specific regions in DNA and control the     
8:10     
flow of genetic information by determining which mrnas are produced so this is where you have you know     
8:17     
transcription factors that bind um to a regulatory region and it     
8:23     
basically tells the uh the polymerase what to trans inscribe for in terms of     
8:31     
the MRNA so there are all sorts of introns and exons and the and the gene in their different areas that are uh you     
8:39     
know ripe to be transcribed in areas that are silenced and they're different     
8:44     
mechanis they even epigenetic mechanisms that are involved in that so you know     
8:50     
this is kind of in the 1960s this was kind of a black box people kind of were     
8:56     
figuring this out since then thousands of trans description factors have been identified and for a long time it was     
9:03     
believed that the main principles of Gene regulation have been solved however in     
9:09     
1993 this year's Nobel laurates published unexpected findings describing a new level of Gene regulation which     
9:16     
turned out to be a highly significant uh which turned out to be highly significant and conserved Road     
9:23     
Evolution So Not only was like their work you know important uh just for like     
9:29     
what the study was but it turned out to be the Cornerstone of a lot of the things we know about it across     
9:36     
species and you know they their evolutionary precursors to this and all that so in the late 1980s Victor Ambrose     
9:44     
and Gary revkin were posto fellows in the laboratory of Robert corbitz uh who's uh was uh awarded the     
9:51     
Nobel Prize in 2002 alongside Sydney brener and John solsten so these are of     
9:57     
course our celan's founders in the sense that they were the first people to work     
10:02     
on uh you know the the sea elegans uh line lineage tree the sea elegans as as     
10:09     
sort of a model organism and all that so this is definitely you know salston and     
10:15     
horvitz they they developed they kind of worked out some of the details of the     
10:21     
post hatch lineage tree the post embrionic lineage tree uh and they you     
10:26     
know they did a lot of stuff like this so in horvitz his laboratory they studied a relatively unassuming 1 mimer     
10:35     
long round worm which is cagans of course uh course seans has many cell     
10:40     
types such as nerve and muscle cells uh it's a useful model thus to     
10:46     
investigate how tissues develop in mature multicellular organisms so both     
10:51     
Ambrose and ren were interested in genes that control the timing of activation of     
10:57     
different genetic programs ensuring that the various cell types develop at the right     
11:02     
time they study two Mutant streams of worm Lin 4 and lin4 so what they     
11:08     
basically in see elegan what you can do is create these defined mutants so the defined mutants are where you have uh     
11:16     
you know like some wild type worm you induce or identify a mutation in this     
11:24     
one of these uh genes or one of these coding regions you know just basic     
11:29     
basically if it has a name and you have a specific mutation that you can isolate     
11:34     
then you back cross worms that have that mutation and you end up with a stable     
11:39     
line with that mutation intact so you can actually then freeze the eggs of the     
11:45     
worm you can raise an entire population with these specific mutations and     
11:52     
there's a whole database available where they have these mutations mapped to the     
11:57     
genome so you you can actually look at function by having these defined mutants     
12:04     
available and knowing where the mutation is so it's it's a very nice system in se     
12:10     
you don't really have you have that in in drop as well but not in like humans     
12:15     
we just don't have that kind of a a way to do these sorts of studies so what     
12:21     
they were looking at were these two Mutant strains of worms Lin 4 and Lin 14     
12:26     
and both of those uh lines display defects in the timing of activation of     
12:32     
genetic programs during development the lates wanted to identify the mutated genes and understand their function     
12:39     
Ambrose had previously shown that The L4 Gene appeared to be a negative regulator of the wi4     
12:45     
gene uh so this is where L4 is negatively regulating 114 this was     
12:51     
just something that they had found in say functional stuff uh however uh how the wind4     
12:58     
activity was blocked was unknown so lin4 basically you know the mutation in lin4     
13:05     
negative or reg regulated the expression of L4 and so it was being blocked we didn't     
13:12     
really know how that was happening we just knew that there was an association between the     
13:17     
two so Ambrose and rivkin were intrigued uh and they set out to resolve these Mysteries so this is a picture of     
13:24     
celegans here and The L4 and L4 mutants this is kind of a diagram of the genome     
13:31     
here just shows the position in the heterochromatin and then you have the     
13:38     
different functional mutants so these are functional mutants so when you have these lines of mutants you can identify     
13:44     
them uh by looking if they express a certain Gene you can use like a fluorescent marker but also you can look     
13:51     
at the phenotype and in this case the phenotype is this kind of phenotype where there's some defect in the way it     
13:58     
moves so you can see this um you know you can't really see it but     
14:04     
you know it's kind of hard to do it just from phenotype but sometimes you know some of     
14:09     
these defined mutants are pretty easy to spot in terms of their phenotype this is     
14:15     
the wi four mutant and this is the wi4 and then this is where we have the     
14:23     
what they've discovered in terms of negative regulation so at one point they just thought that Lin for negative or     
14:29     
regulated L 14 it could just be that they uh you there was some mechanism there what they found was that there was     
14:36     
this micro RNA which is very small that's why it's called micro RNA it's a     
14:41     
very short stretch of uh RNA which binds to the MRNA and or it binds to lin4 and     
14:49     
it basically silences this mRNA so it binds to the MRNA of Lin 14 it silences     
14:55     
that mRNA and so you can see here that there's the microrna here and the MRNA microrna     
15:03     
binding to the MRNA here and silencing it so this is a little bit different     
15:10     
than some of the other regulatory mechanisms um and so that but they found     
15:16     
the specific mechanism and this is the thing they're winning the Nobel Prize     
15:23     
so uh so yeah these you know the idea is that they're complimentary sequences so     
15:30     
when those complimentary sequences are bound it has this functional     
15:35     
effect uh so micr rnas of course it's important to note that they don't code for proteins they merely exist to do     
15:42     
these kinds of things at least not all mRNA micr rnas and we'll talk about that     
15:48     
in a minute uh so yeah they they talk about the discovery there's some key papers     
15:54     
here um and you know there were two papers in the journal cell that kind of went over this and of course this is not     
16:03     
just something that's relevant to celegans uh you have uh let seven of     
16:10     
course is the micro RNA this is uh a second Gene encoding a microrna the gene     
16:16     
is conserved in evolution and is now known that microrna regulation is universal among multicellular organm so     
16:23     
we know that micr rnas can play a functional role or regulatory role     
16:29     
across the Tree of Life okay so we know that there this was discovered in sea     
16:34     
elegans but we know that this exists throughout at least in well in animals and in plants so we know those two uh uh     
16:45     
branches of the Tree of Life uh have this ability so this this is something     
16:52     
that this is this is something that had a lot of physiological impact     
16:59     
just thinking about the role that micro Ras could play and a lot of these other     
17:04     
regulatory rnas can play as well so the key citations here let's see so this is     
17:11     
the one uh uh white men and run postr posttranscriptional regulation of     
17:19     
the heterochronic gene lin4 by lin4 mediates temporal F pattern formation Z     
17:25     
Els this is in cell from 1993 and then this other paper uh Ambrose and     
17:32     
Lee fighten bom Ambrose the SE elegans heterochronic Gene L four encodes small     
17:37     
rnas with anti-sense complimentarity to Li prot te so you know hetero crony is     
17:44     
basically has to do with developmental growth and so they're these like growth     
17:52     
uh things that play a role in the growth of these mutants so when there's a when there's a mutation that means that     
17:59     
it's you know somehow modified from the whale type and it has a a consequence in     
18:05     
the phenotype this is a developmental process where this gets knocked down and     
18:10     
it results in the phenotypes you saw where there's this sort of defect and it has to do with the timing of growth and     
18:18     
development so this is the Nobel Prize site here so this is     
18:23     
a press release it just gives a very basic summary of things     
18:30     
there are a couple papers of course this is uh the one from white man Han and Rubin this is back     
18:37     
1993 plus transcriptional regulation of the heterochronic gene lin4 by lin4     
18:43     
mediates temporal pattern formation in celegans this of course is describing     
18:49     
what they did here so why don't we read the abstract uh so during celan's     
18:56     
development the temporal pattern of many cell lineages is specified by graded     
19:02     
activity of the heterochronic gene L4 here we demonstrate that a temporal     
19:08     
gradient lin4 protein is generated posttranscriptionally by multiple     
19:13     
elements in the lin4 uh three prime untranslated region     
19:18     
which is uh you know part of the uh transcriptional apparatus that are     
19:24     
regulated by the heterochronic gene Lin 4 so remember lin4 is the thing that's producing the protein L4 is the     
19:31     
non-protein cating gene that is B you know the Mr the micro RNA is binding to     
19:36     
the MRNA wind4 and thus blocking it from being produced into a     
19:41     
protein the wind4 three untranslated region or three prime untranslated region it's both necessary and     
19:49     
sufficient to counter L for mediated postranscriptional temporal regulation     
19:55     
so they did this test of necessity and sufficiency so it means that like if you     
20:00     
have this lin4 um you know this thing that happens     
20:06     
in L4 you know is something sufficient to do that or is it necessary and so you know if it's merely     
20:13     
sufficient that might mean that there other mechanisms involved if it's necessary that means     
20:19     
that something is critical so this 3D Prime UT binding activity of Lin 4 is     
20:28     
you know it's necess or it's efficient it's efficient to knock something up     
20:33     
it's also necessary so you know we have this sort     
20:38     
of uh we have this sort of test that they do here and it's important to note this because not every time you talk     
20:45     
about micr RNA are we talking about this test of function of necessity and     
20:51     
sufficiency a lot of times it's like things that are correlated or things that are     
20:56     
associated so in this case we have really kind of nailed down to a specific     
21:03     
uh mechanism in a specific set of genes the function of The L4 three three Prime     
21:10     
on translated region is conserved between SE elegans and C briggy so C     
21:15     
Brigg of course is another cantis model organism uh it's less well known as     
21:21     
celegans but you can use that as sort of a taxonomic outro to look at what's     
21:27     
going on in C if we know something's happening in SE elegans that's also happening in C brigger we know it's not     
21:34     
just a kind of a quirk of SE elegans uh we can't say it's widely conserved or     
21:39     
that what whatever Gene is widely conserved but we know that it's pretty good chance that there's this at least     
21:46     
Canabis level or uh genis level     
21:53     
conservation uh among the conserved sequences there seven elements that are each complimentary to the wind 4     
22:00     
rnas and so we have these uh elements that are complimentary to L4 rnas     
22:07     
remember this is before we had the gene sequence of calans so they had to clone     
22:12     
the genes all you know all the genes and work from kind of like this non you know     
22:18     
you couldn't map it to a reference gen anything like that so it's really you know kind of heroic work I guess would     
22:25     
be the way to put it uh a reporter Gene bearing three of these elements shows partial temporal gradient activity these     
22:32     
data suggest a molecular mechanism for lin 14p temporal gradient     
22:37     
formation and it summarizes as thus the Lin for rna's base pair to the sites in     
22:44     
the l43 Prime on translated region to form multiple RNA duplexes that     
22:49     
downregulate lin4 translation so this is where the lind     
22:55     
for for RNA a parasites so we saw in the diagram where the micr RNA you there's     
23:01     
this complimentary strand it binds to lin4 and the three prime unrated region     
23:08     
which is on the left side of that diagram so let me bu the diagram to show what I'm talking     
23:13     
about so this is again where this is uh you have the complimentary pairing here     
23:22     
uh you know it basically binds and there there's some Loops in the micr RNA so     
23:28     
you know it doesn't have to be a Ono one match it just has the bind parts of the     
23:34     
MRNA down at this three prime untranslated region end so this is the     
23:39     
part that they're talking about so this is kind of how this works and it works to uh down regular     
23:49     
Lin 14 transation so that's basically the study     
23:54     
there and then we might ask some questions about microor in general so I have some reviews on micr rnas uh this     
24:02     
is one from nature reviews genetics think it was from last year December     
24:07     
2023 and this is kind of you know well after this original study this is micro     
24:13     
or in action biogenesis function and regulation so this kind of talks about M     
24:19     
micro oras as a class of regulatory RNA and what it what they do and you know so     
24:26     
they consider kind of things of what's going on in across uh the tree of life I guess     
24:33     
because like I said at least in plants and animals we know this is a major mechanism uh so ever since micr rnas or     
24:40     
Mi rnas were first recognized in as an extensive Gene family uh more than 20     
24:46     
years ago broad community of researchers was drawn to investigate the universe of     
24:51     
small regulatory rnas so micr Ras are just one of these kind of small regulatory rnas us usually smaller than     
24:59     
the transcript themselves and they do these kinds of things where they find the RNA or they modify the RNA in some     
25:05     
way and this is collectively kind of known as this     
25:10     
category of small Regulatory rnas and in turn that's in that category of     
25:17     
posttranscriptional uh modification although core features of Mna biogenesis and function were Reve     
25:25     
revealed early on which we talked about with the work at all paper whatever whoever the first     
25:31     
author was on that recent years continue to uncover fundamental information on the     
25:36     
structureal molecular dynamics of core Mirna Machinery how Mirna substrates and     
25:43     
targets are selected from the transcriptome new avenues for multi-level regulation of Mirna     
25:50     
biogenesis and mechanisms for Mirna turnover so this is something that where     
25:55     
you know mrnas are are produced not all of them are you know used or functional     
26:01     
there's a lot of turnover so they need to be produced at a certain rate uh and there's a there are a lot of mechanisms     
26:08     
for regulating the biogenesis of so it's very very complex     
26:13     
system uh many of these latest insights were enabled by recent technological advances including massively parallel     
26:20     
assays progenic electron microscopy single molecule Imaging and crisper cast     
26:26     
9 screening so they kind of summarize a lot of the details here of what we know     
26:33     
so far now they maybe one take away from this is that you know the original study     
26:39     
was done by kind of cloning genes and you know they didn't have a lot of the     
26:45     
well they didn't have uh genome sequence but they also didn't have nextg sequence     
26:51     
so nowadays we can do nextg sequencing we could get any site in that reference genome we can get transcription or at     
26:58     
least you know some count of the uh messenger ears and then Aline them with     
27:04     
the uh site in the genome that it's being produced so it's much easier to find sort of you know these locations     
27:12     
and what the transcriptional level is and so you know if you see differences if you have like     
27:19     
a mutant versus a non-mutant you see differences then you kind of know that there's something interesting there you     
27:26     
still can't assess like the mechanism or the function from that directly but you     
27:32     
can get a sense of what's going on genome wide especially cross species I     
27:37     
mean as hard as it is to work with nextg sequencing data it still gives you a lot more information and we would have     
27:47     
other uh this is an interesting paper here uh     
27:54     
primary transcripts of micro and code regulatory peptides so this is uh the     
28:00     
abstract here we'll just read this uh micr rnas or mnas or small regulatory     
28:06     
RNA molecules that inhibit the expression of specific Target genes by     
28:12     
binding to and cleaving their messenger rnas or otherwise inhibiting their translation into proteins so sometimes     
28:20     
they cleave the messenger RNA to make it render it unusable it's through the binding when     
28:25     
they do this with the the mic binds the Mr the messenger RNA it Cleaves it at     
28:32     
that site it makes renders it not useful or it does some sort of other inhibition     
28:38     
process where just basically silences that uh     
28:43     
transcript mrnas are transcribed as much larger primary transcripts pre-mrnas the     
28:49     
function of which is not fully understood so basically like I said you know mrnas come from a gene they're very     
28:57     
small so those are the these small SE these small segments of uh micro come     
29:05     
from a larger transcript re mnas and they're somehow partitioned out into     
29:12     
these micro rnas so we don't really understand the functional role here we just know that that's how it     
29:19     
proceeds uh here we show that the plant pre m Mna contain short open reading     
29:25     
frame sequences that encode regulatory pepti so we're talking about the premna which     
29:31     
is this larger transcript that gets chopped up into these micro rnas and we     
29:37     
know that the pre mnas in Plants I guess they're talking about a arabidopsis in     
29:43     
medicago but we have these short open reading frame sequences that basically are these uh micro Ras so we have these     
29:51     
two different species medicago and a arabidopsis they prod these uh they're     
29:57     
talking about the prei R 7 171b which is this premm RNA specific one to these two     
30:05     
species actually in uh medicago it's Mi R 171b and in rabit opsis it's premm R1     
30:14     
165a so they're they're basically related uh these both produce peptides     
30:20     
which we term Mi p 171b and Mi P1 165a respectively then     
30:27     
enance the accumulation of their corresponding mature mnas so this is where again we're     
30:34     
accumulating copies of these mrnas were uh you know getting you know they have     
30:40     
to have a certain sort of I guess Spike ometry to be effective in the cell uh     
30:46     
and so when you get enhance the accumulation of these mature mrnas which is the uh which are the uh     
30:53     
premnas chopped up and ready to go this results in downregulation Target genes     
30:58     
involved in root development so this you can see the same thing that we saw in seans with this developmental growth um     
31:06     
defect you can also see this in root development changes in root development     
31:11     
the mechanism of Mna encoded peptide mipep action involves increasing     
31:17     
transcription of the premm RNA five other preim rnas of aeliana and     
31:23     
M trun truncatula and code active miip peps which are these miip peps     
31:30     
these peptides suggesting that Mi pups are widespread throughout the plant so     
31:36     
this is an a case from Plants where we have these MIP peps or these micropeptides which actually do have     
31:43     
this further like secondary functional effect on these regulatory     
31:49     
rnas five other pre uh Mias okay you did that uh synthetic     
31:56     
uh synthetic miip pep 171b and miip pep 165a peptides applied     
32:03     
to plants specifically trigger the accumulation of Mir 171b and     
32:09     
mir165a leading to a reduction of lateral root development and stimulation of main root growth respectively     
32:17     
suggesting that MIP peps might have been have agronomical applications so this is where you know     
32:23     
instead of looking at like Sean's development we're looking at plant development and it has a similar kind of     
32:31     
effect but we also have the identification of these peptides that are actually involved in     
32:38     
processing the Mirna so you have the the Mirna Gene     
32:44     
which is this larger transcript these peptides act to you know chop these up     
32:50     
into these mRNA the mature Mi rnas then can inhibit the uh messenger RNA of     
32:57     
another Gene and it can have effects on the phen okay uh then we have     
33:05     
this last paper here which is this talking about     
33:12     
function and the role function in biology so you know we've talked about     
33:17     
mrnas and it might seem like the Royal Road here is to say well all M or micr     
33:25     
rnas have a function and we do this very in every species but in fact I've just     
33:31     
pointed out two examples which are very clear examples that doesn't mean that all micras operating the same way and so     
33:39     
this is a uh biology and philosophy paper from 2022 as it's called a relic of design     
33:47     
against proper functions and biology so this talks about kind of you know uh the     
33:53     
role of function in biology so uh the abstract of this paper reads the notion     
34:00     
of biological function is Frau with difficulties intrinsically and irredeemably so we are the philosop the     
34:07     
physiological practice of functional ascription originates from a time when organisms were thought to be designed     
34:14     
and remain largely has remained largely unchanged since in a secularized worldview this creates a paradox which     
34:20     
account accounts functions are selected effect uh as selected effect attempt to     
34:26     
resolve so so in other words they're kind of you know retrospective views of     
34:32     
what the organism does it's like a function originates because it's functional because it's uh you know     
34:38     
maybe an advantage to the organism but sometimes you know as this as this     
34:43     
function is is sort of developing it's just kind of a thing that's you know has no real benefit or has no real function     
34:50     
it just kind of a results from um you know some of these systems kind of you     
34:58     
know becoming manifest so you know this idea of function is interesting because     
35:05     
you can say that something is functional and you can sort of rationalize it as functional but that doesn't mean that it     
35:11     
is functional or that it's universally functional so this is kind of uh they     
35:17     
kind of give like some thoughts about function here uh this attempt we argue misses its Target in physiology and it     
35:24     
brings problems of its own instead we propose it about better solution to the conundrum of biological functions is to     
35:31     
abandon the notion alog together a prospect not only less daunting than it appears but arguably the natural cont uh     
35:39     
continuation of the Naturalization of biolog so that's an interesting take on this now why am I bringing this up this     
35:45     
is because about 10 years ago maybe a little bit longer there is this idea of     
35:52     
well basically encode which was in a uh     
35:59     
like a a group of scientists who came who did a lot of nextg sequencing of a     
36:05     
number of animal genomes they wrote these papers in I think it was nature     
36:10     
and uh basically they they made the statement that something like 90% of our     
36:16     
genome was functional and so you know this is something that was kind of     
36:22     
against the grain of what a lot of people were thinking at the time and so this is again you know maybe it's you     
36:30     
know when when we had uh when the human genome was sequenced uh you know people before the     
36:38     
sequence was released people had a much higher estimate of the number of genes that were in the human genome and when     
36:44     
we actually got the draft sequence then we discovered that there were far fewer gen and so that was an interesting kind     
36:51     
of Revision in this case the uh the encode people you know they kind of came     
36:58     
up with this number of 90% function for the entire genome so 90% of the genome     
37:03     
is generally functional and so this is an example of a database that uh en code     
37:10     
produce this is The Ensemble database this is a very useful database for     
37:15     
finding genes and and functional sequences this is one for celegans so     
37:21     
this is you know where you can look up all these celegans genes I have the search results for lin4 open so we can     
37:28     
actually look across taxa we can look at the gene itself we can look at Associated genes and make comparisons     
37:35     
about where they are on the genome and things like that but the idea that you know that     
37:41     
something is functional is you know it's kind of still a controversial thing right it's like when you say something     
37:48     
is functional you know you can't just simply ask if something is functional you have to ask what are we talking     
37:54     
about in terms of you know what is the relationship between between two genes     
37:59     
is it something like you know causal or is it just merely an association and a     
38:05     
lot of the things that encode found in that 90% category were kind of associations in other words this     
38:12     
transcript is associated with this other thing and the studies that I showed you like the ckin study and some of these     
38:19     
other studies they actually can Target you know specific experiments so that's an interesting     
38:26     
sort of distance there where you have some things that are associative some things that are seemingly positive some     
38:33     
things that are correlative and we see this in other uh Sciences I think um     
38:39     
Morgan uh in one of the slack channels had pointed out that you know in in     
38:45     
connectomics they you know have traditionally called it connectome sort     
38:52     
of like a connection and now they you know and usually kind of implying that     
38:57     
there was some functional significance to the map and of course now people are starting to call them correlative uh     
39:04     
connectomes or correlative Maps because but they actually are cor sets of correlations they're not necessarily     
39:11     
causal but they do give you these nice maps of things that are correlated with     
39:17     
one that's an important point to make and sometimes you know maybe even our concept of function is wrong so this is     
39:24     
a very opinionated piece about the function Wars and again this goes back to 2012 when encode published a lot of     
39:31     
their work and there is push back and there was this conversation about how much of the genome is functional and so     
39:38     
Laur Larry Moran is very much in the category of very little of the genome is     
39:43     
functional and about some of the things that uh kind of kicked off this uh you     
39:51     
know it basically it's about the terminology of function and how much function is there in the G what does it     
39:58     
mean to be functional so this is you know drawing upon things from the history of molecular biology kind of     
40:05     
drawing on things from our newer Technologies and kind of how those     
40:10     
things are kind of colliding so uh I think uh susumu Ono     
40:16     
who was developed a mod of uh neutral Theory uh came to the conclusion that     
40:22     
90% of our genum was Jun and so this is you know kind of the other end of the Spectrum with respect to the encode     
40:30     
findings and so you this is an interesting thing especially with respect to regulatory RNA and its role     
40:38     
in this you know is reg how much of regulatory RNA is you know truly     
40:43     
functional say at the causal level and how much of it is from existing places     
40:48     
in the genome and all this so this is one of these things that are kind of     
40:54     
still being sorted out and you know has implications for theory has implications     
41:00     
for uh biology and it has implications for evolution     
41:05     
so that's uh my recap of the sort of the Nobel Prize for this year I thought that     
41:12     
was worth covering because it's seans based um yeah I know there was a lot of     
41:20     
molecular biology hopefully I cover it decently     
41:29     
okay any questions about that I'll have to review it uh     
41:37     
again just I'm very weak in Mike B um um     
41:47     
chemistry biological chemistry yeah yeah it's not not easy uh to to get     
41:56     
your heton sometimes like a lot of these newer discoveries are like you know     
42:01     
there're all these new categories of things like uh you know different types of rnas I mean there got to be at least     
42:08     
50 different types of rnas now and uh you know it's very daunting to sort of     
42:14     
get everything straight and to know what it does or what it doesn't do not that we know a lot of what it does and     
42:19     
doesn't do there are a lot of different types of rnas like that do different things or at least that we've discovered     
42:25     
that are kind of unique you know unique uh at least function in one system and     
42:31     
then you know can you extrapolate it out to every     
42:38     
system okay all right     
42:43     
so okay so this is um this is something that uh Morgan pointed out to me as well     
42:50     
so we've talked about uh pattern formation and     
42:55     
morphogenesis and and uh there are different ways you can have morphogenesis you can have single cell     
43:03     
morphogenesis you can have other types of you know there are many models that you can use for morphogenesis one of     
43:10     
them of course is turn's reaction diffusion model and you know kind of     
43:16     
understanding that that's really the way that pattern formation occurs like striping or some other pattern that you     
43:23     
want to get in development so you know there's usually some sort of diffusion     
43:29     
of a of a factor an agent you know they call the morphogens     
43:34     
in turning reaction Fusion those morphogens form a gradient at the edge of those gradients you get a reaction     
43:40     
and you get say like a stripe so you get alternating Stripes by having a bunch of     
43:45     
gradients that sort of meet at these stripe boundaries and that's how you get     
43:51     
this kind of pattern formation in organisms and so you know there are a lot of math models for this you can use     
43:58     
couple differential equations and it's you know it's it's known very widely as     
44:04     
chemical morphogenesis so it involves chemical agents and you know it produces This     
44:11     
Global pattern so you start from like the diffusion of molecules diffusion of     
44:17     
uh morphogens and you get these global patterns and so this P this talk is     
44:24     
actually part of the series of this is     
44:29     
not yeah but this talk is actually part of the series of YouTube lectures inii     
44:35     
satellite events this is the Isaac Newton Institute so this is creating a hub for mathematics in the UK so this is     
44:43     
uh on YouTube and they have a bunch of videos and so the video I was looking at     
44:50     
here was and this is shared to me by Morgan he's always sharing interesting     
44:55     
YouTube videos on talks and this is the emergence of classical pattern formation     
45:02     
Dynamics from Quantum models so this is um you know this this sort of chemical     
45:09     
morphogenesis this pattern on this fish and you have you know the sort of     
45:14     
quantum model explanation of it so instead of using sort of the standard     
45:20     
way of modeling uh Trin reaction diffusion he's using a series of quantum     
45:26     
models and talking about things like solons and their role in this process it's very     
45:32     
interesting stuff     
45:38     
um so you know one of the first things he talked about in the talk was or these disperse of     
45:44     
hydrodynamics so you know we're interested we have to be when we talk about hydrodynamics we have to use a new     
45:51     
class of meth or of methods you know so we're thinking about math we're thinking     
45:56     
about IST with him Theory astics I'm not really familiar with a lot of these methods but you know he's a     
46:03     
mathematician and a physicist so that's I'm just going to take his word for it that these are you know relevant methods     
46:10     
basically you're looking at something diffusing in water dispersing outward so this is basically you know chemical     
46:16     
morphogenesis you have these uh gradients which are basically dispersion events in in some mediums it could be     
46:23     
hyro it's you know usually some sort of liquid or you know something like that so you can use hydrodynamic Theory to     
46:29     
describe it and you have of course some systems of interest you have water waves     
46:35     
Quantum gases nonlinear Optics those are all relevant to this problem and then the interplay of nonlinearity and     
46:42     
dispersive transport so you know we're interested in nonlinearity interested in curvature because that's a biological     
46:49     
system and you know we have these challenges to model this one of the challenges of turning reaction to Fusion     
46:55     
is it's good for modeling a two-dimensional pattern but you know it's it's like not really descriptive of     
47:01     
three-dimensional patterns or nonlinearities and so this is where we can use solons and solitary structures     
47:10     
to understand these things so solons are basically these     
47:15     
waves that exist um I have a description of solons here     
47:25     
um and this is Wikipedia article on solons so you can see there's a solitary     
47:30     
wave here um so solons are hard really to describe they just there are     
47:36     
different material effects of properties that are shared so it's kind of like the     
47:41     
same problem we had in the realm of regulatory rnas it's hard to Define what     
47:47     
they do as a class it's just like they all have like similar attributes um so aaton is a nonlinear     
47:55     
self- reinforced ing localized wave packet so this is something it's nonlinear it's     
48:01     
self-reinforcing and it's localized that is strongly stable and that it preserves its shape while propagating freely so     
48:08     
you can see that this wave will propagate it's kind of like a wave on the ocean where it's moving across the     
48:13     
surface of the ocean but it's preserving its shape more or less um and then it's     
48:20     
uh propagating at constant velocity and it recovers even after collisions with     
48:25     
other such localized packets so this is interesting that it actually can recover     
48:30     
after a collision so this means that you could have like one of these gradients     
48:36     
and you could have a boundary where they Collide and you can have like a stripe     
48:42     
and then that radient would continue on the other side I guess that's what a adding a Solon here would mean and so     
48:49     
you can have these kind of nonlinear and dispersive effects that you know may explain some of the you know things that     
48:57     
aren't like striping patterns like some of the like the the pattern that we saw in the fish in first in that first slide     
49:03     
from the talk is that you know you can have these higher order patterns and you     
49:09     
know it's useful that way so you know we can use partial linear different partial     
49:14     
differential equations to describe pelotons so that's why they're kind of interesting you can also look at the     
49:21     
particle wave duality of these different phenomena so this is an interesting here     
49:28     
um so we have let's go back to this slide so this     
49:34     
is where we talk about solons where are solons so surprising how physical quantities are and can be transported is     
49:42     
a fundamental importance to physics so we want to know how not only just describe diffusion but transport things     
49:49     
and so the transport of these morphogens around in this medium which is of course     
49:54     
the thing that's exhibiting morphogen uh nature tends to deize concentrations     
50:00     
of matter energy information so that means that nature we tend to see diffusions whether it be like in the     
50:08     
statistical mechanic sense where we have entropy and things kind of diffuse into     
50:13     
sort of this ground state or we have things that diffuse from a source in diffusion you know different types of     
50:20     
diffusion and biology that we see all the time or that we have things like energy and information that and tend to     
50:28     
De localize from a central point and of course in morphogenesis that's important because we have these gradients     
50:34     
basically we have very high concentration of something and it it basically diffuses to lower     
50:40     
concentrations as you go along but you can also have diffusions of those high levels of concentration in space they     
50:48     
can move around in space as a wave or you can have different properties of the     
50:53     
gradient as a wave so this is an interesting kind of uh Point that he's bringing to this which is that you have     
51:00     
this sort of these different aspects of thinking about um ter     
51:05     
morphogenesis and as a result we have these different interesting Dynamics so he says that solons are a balance of two     
51:13     
ingredients hel localizing transport and nonlinearity so moving moving things     
51:19     
around in that space of morphogenesis and having this nonlinear type of     
51:25     
morphogenesis so this is a sketch of the tring mechanism you see that like you have uh the two species system which are     
51:33     
these couple differential equations and you have you know you assume there exist     
51:38     
homogeneous solutions for U and v0 and there's your from these two terms here     
51:46     
uh and then you know we're thinking about linearizing uh U v0 and tring found     
51:52     
conditions under which homogeneous Solutions destabilize so they ing uh uh     
51:58     
chemical morphogenesis model is basically an equilibrium model it's where you have this homogeneous solution     
52:05     
now in cases where you don't have this homogeneous pattern formation then you know you're talking about a different     
52:11     
maybe a different set of mechanisms so you have this uh these conditions under     
52:16     
homogeneous Solutions destabilize meaning they become nonlinear where they become unstable so that's what diffusion     
52:24     
brings you have this fish up at the top which has this kind of regularized pattern you add diffusion and you get     
52:30     
this kind of uh I don't know I don't remember what this pattern is called it's a like almost like a batov     
52:37     
jabotinsky reaction but it's like not that or maybe it is but that's basically     
52:43     
what it looked like um but anyways instability leads to spatial patterns so     
52:48     
this is where you get this instability this chemic one stability leads these spatial patterns like the bellat ja have     
52:56     
a TCAP reaction um and then steady States reach through nonlinear interaction so to get     
53:01     
a steady state after an instability you need to have these nonlinear interactions that result in a pattern     
53:07     
like this being transformed into a pattern like this or more to the point a set of mechanisms that produce a pattern     
53:14     
like this can produce a pattern like this if you add in instabilities and     
53:20     
diffusion so how do you get the diffusion and reaction diffusion that's an important point because it is two     
53:26     
comp two compartment system you have the reaction but you also have the diffusion     
53:32     
and so at the microscopic level you have these disordered particle Dynamics     
53:37     
particles moving around in the space they could be moving around a cube where they're kind of moving you know at     
53:43     
random angles and bouncing around the cube and they're delocalizing that     
53:48     
they're kind of like you know random um you also have diffusive hydrodynamics     
53:53     
and that's the macroscopic picture so if we have this uh I think it's this blob of ink in     
54:00     
water you drop a blob of ink in and it starts to diffuse outward and it diffuses equally across the volume until     
54:07     
you end up with this liquid that has the dye equally distributed so the idea is you have this blob which is sort of a     
54:15     
heterogeneous mixture of you know water and ink and then the ink defuses through     
54:21     
the water column and then you get this volume where it's basically more diffused more     
54:27     
so you get this macroscopic diffusion of H in a hydrodynamic medium and so that's     
54:32     
these are two different views of uh re of diffusion and so you can actually model     
54:39     
this as a random walk you can you know have go from zero and you can move to the left and to the right on a     
54:44     
onedimensional um space so you can do this one-dimensional random walk say     
54:50     
that steps occur at every Small Time inter of the delta T then you get this term taking small Quick Step L we expand     
54:58     
and there's more math here that leads us to the solution of diffusion so you know     
55:04     
what does this have to do with quantum mechanics at this point we've just been describing uh morphogenesis in sort of     
55:10     
the reaction diffusion model kind of going talking about these instabilities talking about these different types of     
55:17     
nonlinearities but then you can add in this other layer of uh quantum mechanics     
55:23     
so what we've been talking about so far especially would say like diff Fusion is statistical mechanics it can all be     
55:29     
described with some sort of statistical mechanics with hydrodynamic equations Etc why do we need quantum mechanics and     
55:36     
so there's this relationship between quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics the short andure equation the     
55:44     
wick rotation and then those kind of I have a connection to reaction to Fusion     
55:49     
equations um and then there's this quote some physicists myself included feel     
55:55     
that there may be something profound here that we have not quite understood and that maybe is the whole point here     
56:02     
is that there's this connection here in the math but we don't really know what that means in terms of what's going on     
56:09     
with these sort of cases of nonlinear pattern pattern     
56:14     
formation um this and of course he gets into this idea of drift and curvature so when we talk about drift we talk about     
56:20     
diffusion we talk about this usually in a in a sort of a normalized space it     
56:27     
could be a one-dimensional line segment it could be a two-dimensional uh surface it could be     
56:33     
like this volume that's you know where we end up with its uniformity but we also in biology of course we have     
56:39     
curvature and a lot of times very uh Exquisite curvature so this is curvature     
56:44     
of a pattern we have this uh squid and the surface of the squid is you know     
56:50     
curved it has tentacles all this stuff and these patterns of course are on     
56:55     
these curvatures so how does the pattern form on these curvatures and is it in     
57:00     
the same way that we might view a two-dimensional uh pattern formation uh     
57:06     
situation uh where we have these neat uh you know gradients and they meet and they give you these formations so     
57:13     
actually we know we have to describe drift or we have to describe curvature as its own thing so we do this and this     
57:20     
is interesting it says equivalent to reaction diffusion in a hyperbolic space so we do this reaction to Fusion we do     
57:27     
this in a ukian space usually uh but now we can actually extend this to a hyperbolic space and so the hyperbolic     
57:35     
spaces described uh in case you're not aware of what hyperbolic spaces are they're     
57:42     
basicly spaces with a curvature so they're basically redian manifolds which     
57:48     
have this sort of curvature to them and you can you know it's very different from a ukian space because um you know     
57:56     
you basically move along a hyperbolic space and your reference points change     
58:01     
in a way that's very different from a Idan space there is usually a constant     
58:06     
positive or negative curvature to hyperbolic space that makes it very hard to sort of you know maintain those     
58:14     
relationships those idian relationships that we think of when we think of like     
58:20     
the standard sort of toy model of um of     
58:25     
the reaction to Fusion so if we think of like a two-dimensional space we say okay we get these neat stripes and we can     
58:32     
describe those but in a hyperbolic space we don't actually get that we get these curvatures and of course these diffusion     
58:39     
along curvatures is different than diffusion along a flat surface and so this is a very important Concept in     
58:46     
terms of thinking about how this uh how morphogenesis     
58:52     
proceeds okay so we have a of course we have exotic phenomena from non-     
58:58     
hermeticity and it gives some citations here talking about Edge effects uh this     
59:04     
is where you know you have these edges and kind of talks about that and in curvatures and things like     
59:10     
that okay so then we have this simple reaction diffusion talks about some of     
59:15     
this uh you know with some of the parameters and what they're doing in in     
59:21     
uh this model we have drifting curvature again this time we have     
59:26     
sort of reaction diffusion on hyperbolic space he has this interesting uh part of     
59:32     
the figure here where he has this uh set of concentric circles and kind of a tree drawn out along those circles I'm     
59:38     
interested in following up on that because we've done some work on this talking about differentiation waves and     
59:45     
these sort of you know how you model that in a curvature or in a curved space namely in a in a spherical space so this     
59:53     
is might be an interesting thing to follow up on uh you also have sub diffusion with     
59:58     
nonlinearity so again we we're talking about diffusion and nonlinearity we're talking and with in quantum mechanics we     
1:00:06     
have tunneling so we have the ability to have say a Solon move across these uh     
1:00:14     
gradient boundaries and continue across the surface a curved surface of an     
1:00:19     
organism and use that same uh framework to describe the pattern formation there     
1:00:26     
uh there's extensions of General reaction diffusion we can use the complex FFF hunenberg equation to sort     
1:00:32     
of extend a general reaction diff Fusion model so this is where we have subcases     
1:00:39     
include real Swift hunenberg complex Ro Ginsburg landow these are things I'm     
1:00:44     
Vaguely Familiar with but basically uh Ginsburg landow I think has been used in     
1:00:50     
uh morphogenesis it's just kind of an extension of the simple reaction diffusion model     
1:00:57     
and so some of the most paradigmatic models of plastical pattern formation so these are sort of like outside of     
1:01:03     
morphogenesis we have these different models of pattern formation that you know can be used in     
1:01:10     
this framew and then this is again our our fish with the complex pattern on a     
1:01:15     
curved body and we're explaining how that forms and so we get this so the     
1:01:21     
take-home points are three uh nonh herian systems allow for the simulation     
1:01:27     
of classical reaction diffusion Dynamics without Disorder so we know that we can     
1:01:33     
simulate classical ref reaction diffusion Dynamics without disorder in     
1:01:38     
equilibrium uh reaction diffusion systems with convection are equivalent to convection     
1:01:45     
L systems in a suitably curved space so this is interesting that we can add convection into our reaction diffusion     
1:01:51     
system we can do this uh you know we were talking about hydram DCS earlier     
1:01:57     
convection is something that we can use to sort of upset the equilibrium create     
1:02:02     
a heterogeneous environment and then that is actually something equivalent to     
1:02:07     
looking at a convectional system or a laminer system in a suitably curved     
1:02:14     
space so if we add curvature it's like adding convection to traditional     
1:02:20     
reaction to Fusion then finally classical and Quantum transport are closely linked so you can use Quantum     
1:02:26     
transport to describe classical transport in more sort of nonlinear terms so these are the things that he     
1:02:32     
kind of pointed to um in the talk I thought that was a really interesting     
1:02:38     
talk thank you Morgan for bringing that to my attention it has a lot of points that I think are useful uh and thinking     
1:02:44     
about reaction to Fusion in different ways especially you know if you're interested in these complex curvatures     
1:02:50     
complex spaces and we don't think about that enough we just kind of assume that everything will translate from the 2D     
1:02:56     
case from the equilibrium case to the larger the more complex cases and then     
1:03:01     
simply may not be the case uh so you know we we have a talk I     
1:03:06     
did uh at the beginning of the year on different types of morphogenetic models     
1:03:12     
you know going through the one-dimensional the two-dimensional multi-dimensional talking about like     
1:03:17     
Ginsburg landow talking about uh bellat jabotinsky reactions talking about uh     
1:03:23     
Turin chemical morphogenesis and some other models and kind of thinking about it in terms of     
1:03:29     
onedimensional two-dimensional higher dimensional spaces and you know each of     
1:03:34     
these models have mathematical structure that are like they treat uh     
1:03:39     
morphogenesis as being these compartments so in onedimensional morphogenesis we have one compartment in     
1:03:48     
uh two-dimensional morphogenesis we have something like reaction to Fusion so usually in onedimensional morphogenesis     
1:03:54     
simply diffusion and we just treat that as the only parameter of interest in reaction     
1:04:01     
diffusion we treat reaction diffusion as separate things and then in the higher dimensional models we have reaction diff     
1:04:08     
fusion and some other mechanisms and I think this type of model the quantum     
1:04:14     
mechanics model fits into that higher order of morphogenetic models so we have     
1:04:19     
reaction diffusion curvature nonlinear we have maybe four or five different compartments     
1:04:26     
and so you know this is kind of an interesting extension of classical developmental morphogen     
1:04:33     
genetic work so um that's that's all I have um any     
1:04:39     
questions what's the background math for that um something that's probably beyond     
1:04:47     
my grasp um it's a lot of quantum mechanics there's quantum mechanics so     
1:04:52     
you have to be familiar with that math but there's also like stuff in um like     
1:04:58     
hydrodynamics which is probably accessible you know to an engineer you know like mechanical engineering um and     
1:05:06     
then you know like you know there's other I guess there's other like math on transport sub diffusion that's like     
1:05:14     
standard kind of Def you know standard physics it's not quantum physics and so     
1:05:19     
that's not like too hard to figure out but uh you know I mean I don't know I don't know much about Quant mechanics i'     
1:05:26     
to be honest uh so I I kind of don't know what kind of programs you could use     
1:05:32     
to model some of these things um well you can get uh you can take quantum     
1:05:38     
mechanics uh through MIT online courses they have a pile of YouTube videos on     
1:05:45     
quantum mechanics some of which I don't really care to take yeah I know I know oh my     
1:05:57     
gosh sort of well these are Einstein's equations you have to know     
1:06:02     
these yeah right yeah there is a lot of background that's what I mean accessible like what     
1:06:08     
could I I don't have to like spend five years learning things     
1:06:15     
but it's a great series though I mean interesting examples that     
1:06:22     
they have I as my engineering training gave     
1:06:28     
me some quantum mechanics but um     
1:06:34     
anyways yeah it's hard to like kind of get your like where you can actually play with it you know you know it's like     
1:06:41     
I know like there are a lot of things you can understand the equations and then you have to kind of like be creative with it and like sometimes the     
1:06:49     
to a fault because I mean some I think some of this is a little bit of a like you're just trying to find interesting     
1:06:56     
analog mathematical analoges is that really going to give you the thing that     
1:07:01     
you want it's kind of hard to say     
1:07:12     
yeah I'm interested though um     
1:07:18     
about um something on a sphere like looking at curvature yes     
1:07:25     
um that would be useful yeah I mean believe it or     
1:07:33     
not your reactions um occur     
1:07:38     
on a sphere can you hear me if I you well yeah     
1:07:45     
reactions um on the bends in say the     
1:07:52     
mitochondria okay yeah it Bend energy they call it okay     
1:08:02     
yeah yeah yeah surprisingly like you know that's not like the first thing     
1:08:09     
that when people talk about morphogenesis uh that they don't like     
1:08:14     
think okay it's curved it's on a curved surface let's assume a curved surface the people assume a flat surface or     
1:08:21     
something like that well it's it's not and you have to take into account the     
1:08:26     
curves yeah yeah okay um any other things before we     
1:08:34     
go any other questions comments all right that's all for today     
1:08:39     
uh thanks for attending and we'll see you next week yes thanks for having us yeah yeah     
1:08:46     
take care take care bye
