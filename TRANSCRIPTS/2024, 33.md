## TRANSCRIPT

0:01     
hello hello hi how are you hi I'm good how are you all     
0:11     
right so um I don't know where you are with your project Pocky but um did you     
0:18     
want to give an update on that or a presentation uh yes sure uh I'll be just     
0:25     
a second all right uh so in my last PR     
0:32     
I the work that I had pushed to the repo was basically to add like uh new nodes     
0:40     
like the graph was learning to add the nodes and then after like since that year I was working on uh making the     
0:48     
edges like uh placing those nodes at appropriate distances from each other so     
0:54     
I just added that functionality as well and uh it's it's working fine now     
1:01     
like I'm uh through with all the errors and everything and uh uh I did not use back     
1:08     
propagation because like the growth of the graph is like not linear so to say     
1:13     
so like back propagating the losses and then uh learning from that was not possible here so I use the CM algorithm     
1:21     
for that for optimization and uh uh yeah so I tried running it     
1:29     
yesterday today but uh like after 63 CS     
1:34     
or something the code just you know keeps running for like half an hour and it's taking a lot of time to go because     
1:41     
I don't have GPU on my device yeah so I was trying to run it on collab today and     
1:47     
there also like I was facing some errors because then I have to ship all the     
1:52     
tensors to the GPU right so I was just a bit uh busy with that today so I'm     
2:00     
through I just need to run this and this is how like the graph is looking now     
2:06     
okay yeah yeah this was for like only a few cells I like fixed all the errors     
2:13     
for the few cells then I ran it over the whole data set so that looks good um yeah I wanted to mention one     
2:21     
more thing that the graph generator from this will not be appropriate because the     
2:27     
these two CSV f is actually uh there were some cells present in one and not     
2:33     
present in the other so like giving that data to graph was causing some errors     
2:38     
for me so I just merged the two and like made another CSV which had only the     
2:44     
common cells so it may not contain all the SS I just wanted to mention that     
2:49     
okay well that's yeah I don't know you know the I don't know why that is but     
2:55     
yeah sometimes you have to do that when you merge data sets is just find them minimal set that matches both of them     
3:02     
but I think that should be fine it looks like you've done pretty well um yeah you might have some computational issues uh     
3:10     
if you're not running if you don't have access to a GPU but I mean the idea is to be able to create open source     
3:16     
software that people can run if they have access to a GPU or more direct     
3:22     
access and so I mean I think that's good it looks like you know at least you've     
3:27     
been able to test it a little bit um so what are your plans for submission     
3:33     
uh submitting to the project portal and so forth I think this was what I had     
3:40     
proposed and this is working uh fine so far like till wherever it ran the losses     
3:46     
were going down is one thing that I could notice so I think uh this should     
3:53     
be it like once I get it running on GPU and like uh I'll confirm that it's     
3:59     
learning to the entire data set then I think I'll be submitting this along with     
4:04     
like a Blog I'll be writing the next couple of days okay so will that be fine     
4:12     
yeah should fine yeah so the final submission date I think is the 23rd next     
4:17     
Monday so you have like a week another week I think to submit um I would double check like the     
4:25     
time in the day but like yeah I think you can do that and like submit uh     
4:30     
through the portal now the portal they require you know one link where everything is there and you you know if     
4:37     
you want to write a blog post with links to all of like the repo and a lot of the     
4:43     
things that people would need to run the program that would be good um just have     
4:48     
that kind of all in one place something that's permanent so like you know working on the gso repo um or working on     
4:57     
the GitHub repo you'll be able to have that as a permanent link um you can     
5:02     
submit that you can also submit a blog post that would describe what you did too maybe you know describe what you did     
5:11     
some of the data sets you use some of the challenges that you faced so like you know GPU access definitely would be     
5:18     
a challenge you could mention that and some of the other things about like the     
5:24     
repurposing some of the existing software and you know running into     
5:30     
some issues there that would be a problem you know so you can just mention     
5:36     
those things and you know it's it's good that you know you don't need to have a perfect submission just a good stopping     
5:43     
point so this looks like a good stopping point all right uh I was thinking of     
5:51     
writing like the instructions to run everything in the reading itself in the blog I'll just be sharing the experience     
5:57     
the challenges and like that aler yeah that sounds good sounds good thank you     
6:03     
was good thank you okay so um I don't know if mahul     
6:10     
will join us because he's also uh needing to finish up and submit     
6:16     
his work so I don't know if you had anything to say dick anything to share     
6:22     
not right now no all right plus you want to know about three-dimensional Imaging     
6:27     
of G galaxies okay so I had a couple of new papers that     
6:33     
came out um on Theory and and developmental biology so I thought we'd take a look at     
6:40     
those and you know see what what uh people were thinking in terms of     
6:46     
theory and uh so let's let's take a look so this first paper is uh towards     
6:55     
an understanding of animal development this came out in actually in 2020     
7:01     
uh this came across my desk recently um and this is from I think     
7:08     
development is the journal so this is yeah this is development so this is an interesting uh     
7:16     
let's see what they have to say in the abstract so almost all animals undergo embryonic development going from a     
7:23     
single cell zygote to a complex multicellular adult we know that the patterning of     
7:28     
morphogenetic genc processes involved in development are deeply conserved within the Animal Kingdom so they have this     
7:35     
perspective of evolutionary conservation of development and they're interested in     
7:42     
this patterning and morphogenetic process however the origins of these     
7:49     
developmental processes are just beginning to be unveiled here we focus on how the     
7:54     
protest lineages sister to animals which are so in     
8:00     
evolution of course we have a tree and we have clades and those clades are uh     
8:06     
groups of closely related species and they form groups so you have     
8:13     
uh groups you know there's a whole nomenclature of uh uh gener classes     
8:20     
orders kingdoms was     
8:27     
that oh     
8:38     
so uh okay so and then of course there's this     
8:46     
uh we have the animal kingdom which is what we're talking about and we're kind of focusing on     
8:53     
protus lineages which are not in animals but sister to animals meaning it's     
8:59     
the you know the next sort of uh clay over and if you take a larger view of     
9:05     
things it's protus plus animals and that's that whole clade that's what they're saying here uh the protest     
9:13     
lineage sister to animals are reshaping our view of animal development so they're looking at protest development     
9:19     
and they're thinking about like the lessons we can learn about animal development and also you know that     
9:26     
animal development doesn't include all the diversity of development that we see in protest lineages so we have this sort     
9:33     
of sister CLA which is a rival group or an alternate sort of pathway and     
9:39     
evolution and that gives us more instances of development they're closely     
9:46     
related so we know that they maybe have the same evolutionary precursors but this is you know kind of     
9:53     
the perspective they're taking that they're investigating this protest lineage     
9:59     
most intriguingly many of these protan lineages display transient multicellular     
10:05     
structures so this is where you know you look at things like yeast where they have are single cell organisms but they     
10:13     
form these collectives or these clusters they can actually plump into large     
10:18     
collectives these transi multicellular structures that don't persist like in a a formal organismal     
10:27     
sort of organization but they do have this sort of uh ability to form multicellular     
10:33     
structures these transient multicellular structures are governed by similar morphogenetic and Gene regulatory     
10:40     
processes and that's parallel to animal development so you have the same sort of     
10:46     
uh Gene regulatory networks and other types of morphogenetic aspects that you     
10:51     
see in animal formal animals okay we discussed here two     
10:56     
potential alternative scenarios to Explain the origin of animal embryonic development so they have two sort of     
11:04     
alternate scenarios the first is either it originated conc contaminant at the     
11:10     
onset of animals which means that it originated at the same time as sort of     
11:15     
the animal uh clay uh started to evolve so in other words they share a set of     
11:21     
mechanisms protest and animals and they uh sort of develop those     
11:27     
independently but they evolved or they originated at the point at which animals     
11:33     
and Proto shared a common ancestor or evolved for Morag genetic processes already present in their     
11:40     
unicellular ancestors so that means that the either     
11:45     
sort of the common ancestor of animals and protests had this mechanism or it     
11:50     
was something that was going on even in unicellular organisms and maybe in some     
11:56     
unicellular organisms it was lost in some way so this is something that you know we     
12:01     
don't really know the answer to we can find you know we can look at like uh     
12:06     
molecular biology for maybe for Clues we can look at other types of organismal     
12:11     
models for Clues so we have you know there ways that we can kind of uh investigate this but it's still an open     
12:18     
question as to exactly where the origins of um development come     
12:26     
from and you know as the side I think last year I did a thing for Darwin day     
12:32     
on uh fossil embryos and you know you see fossil embryos very you see     
12:39     
potentially fossil embryos very very early in evolution so this is something     
12:44     
that maybe is happening deep you know deep in evolutionary time so you might     
12:51     
be getting some of these types of things that you see in animal development uh deep in evolutionary     
12:58     
time we propose that an integrative study of cell several unicellular taxa     
13:03     
closely related to animals will allow a more refined picture of how the last common ancestor of animals underw     
13:10     
embryonic development so that's the abstract so they talk about sort of the     
13:18     
introduction here basically a similar thing where you know what we're talking     
13:24     
about here is uh so we have have learned a lot     
13:29     
about animal development and the diversity of Developmental processes across different animal     
13:36     
files complex Gene regulation is key to the development of animals which is     
13:41     
orchestrated by a precise combination of genes activated in inactivated at the right time and place giving rise to cell     
13:48     
patterning morphogenesis we know many of the specific genes of play a crucial role in the control of animal development and     
13:56     
understand how their absence impacts embryonic development but of course then the question is how did animal develop     
14:02     
and arise and they get into that     
14:08     
uh so basically it says there could be a     
14:13     
tendency to consider animals as an evolutionarily unique lineage but they share a not so ancient common ancestor     
14:20     
with several unicellular lineages and the consensus say that animals evolve from a unicellular protest ancestor     
14:29     
thus if we want to understand the origins of animal development we need to figure out how it's related to these     
14:36     
unicellular examples uh so okay now they talk about     
14:42     
it here molecular philogyny show the animals and fungi share a common ancestor with several unicellular     
14:50     
lineages forming what is known as the aista clade aista means posterior     
14:57     
flagellum and since this grrip is defined by an ancestral state with a single posterior     
15:04     
flagellum uh the opis opis theot are     
15:10     
divided into two main clades or groups the holozoa which includes animals and     
15:15     
their closest unicellular relatives that's our where we are and the holota     
15:21     
which includes fungi and their unicellular relatives so it's actually a fungi it's     
15:27     
fungi and some of the unicellular organisms uh in this BL most relevant     
15:35     
species for studying the origins of animal development are therefore the unicellular lineages of the hola which     
15:42     
include the coagulates the fastrans the eosp orians and the coral     
15:50     
uh kyrian so those are the there no common names yet but the quano flages are one     
15:59     
example among the UN cellular relatives of animals there is a tremendous morphological     
16:05     
disparity H lineage showing vastly different life cycles and strategies copulates are free living and have a     
16:12     
flagellum surounded by a collar of microvi they eat bacteria in some     
16:17     
species of a colonial state formed by colonal division so they have this clonal division which is where the cell     
16:24     
divides on its own it's much like what we see in animals where you get these     
16:29     
cell divisions in development but these are sort of phonal divisions of the     
16:35     
organism and you know they don't require any sort of crossover or uh sexual     
16:41     
reproduction it's asexual reproduction of the cells and they do this colonal Division and they can form this colonial     
16:48     
state where there are a bunch of cells that are in a group panop flatulates have been known     
16:55     
since the 19th century and there are more than 100 described species date in     
17:01     
contrast blasians are relatively novel to science only four described species     
17:06     
three of them fre living TRS and one potential parasite uh I'll display a filopodial     
17:13     
amoeba morphology and some have flatu States so this is a tree that shows kind     
17:20     
of where this is so we have uh let's see we have the metazoa here which are all     
17:27     
animals you know you have Inver vertebrates Etc and so that would include I     
17:34     
guess uh that include most animals that we know and then chopula     
17:42     
flula is here and these are these clonal organisms here there is     
17:49     
fisteria which are these organisms here osoria which are these uh they look     
17:57     
like you know kind of this uh corallo kyria plur formia like     
18:07     
this and then holota which are fungi the fungi are sort of the outgroup of all of these so     
18:14     
you have animals you have all these groups here and then so you get the     
18:20     
unicellular holozoa which is down here which is animals and protests kind of     
18:26     
their common ancestor that common ancestors is then related to holom Mota     
18:31     
which are fungi and then within holozoa you have metazoa and you     
18:38     
have these protest uh clades here and so that's what we're looking at     
18:45     
we're looking at these groups here we're looking at their ability to do things that are sort of     
18:50     
Developmental and we're looking at how they maybe are related to animals or different from animals and we assume     
18:57     
since they have a common ancestor that these are sort of like Developmental Pathways not taken by     
19:02     
animals for various reasons so they talk about     
19:08     
multicellularity um so an intriguing feature of some protests is that they     
19:14     
are closely related to animals or uh an intriguing feature of some     
19:20     
protests that are closely related to animals is that they display a multicellular life stage so they have     
19:26     
this sort of multicellular St stage uh this strongly suggests that the ancestors of animals had the capacity     
19:33     
for one or more multicellular life stages it is worth noting that multicellularity can be achieved through     
19:40     
three different strategies first multicellularity can be achieved by colal division such as in     
19:46     
animals or plants another option is to obain obtain a multicellular organism by cell     
19:53     
aggregation such as in Social amibas although cellular aggregation is     
19:58     
widespread new carots it tends to give rise only to transient and reversible multicellular     
20:04     
States uh so another words you get these sort of different types of     
20:10     
multicellular uh States sometimes it's a a formal life stage uh sometimes it's     
20:16     
transient and reversible so they just kind of aggregate for a little while and there's no Defined Life Stage that it     
20:23     
belongs to and then finally multicellularity can be achieved by undergoing a     
20:30     
multinucleate uh development with later cellularization strikingly we find an     
20:36     
example of each of these modes in each of the protest uh Pro Protestant     
20:41     
lineages therefore it is conceivable that the unicellular ancestor of animals could develop temporary multicellular     
20:48     
structures by any or all of the routes depending on environmental conditions     
20:56     
importantly there are a few indications of cellular differentiation occurring across the cells forming any of these     
21:03     
multicellular stages division of labor across cell types is one of the Criterion of complex     
21:10     
multicellularity so far restricted to a few lineages so that includes plants animals fungi and ous     
21:17     
LG so there's a difference between this sort of transient multicellularity where     
21:23     
cells come together in these clumps and then this sort of formal     
21:29     
multicellularity or complex multicellularity where there's this division of labor so the division of     
21:34     
labor can be thought of as sort of the formation of tissues or organs where one group of cells does one thing one group     
21:41     
of cells does another thing and there's this dependence of the different cell groups that's one of the things we're     
21:48     
trying to model with our uh hypergraphs is this idea of     
21:54     
interdependence of different parts of a multicellular aggreg if it were just a     
21:59     
matter of forming a network you know we could have a network we could have a network of transient     
22:05     
multicellularity just with the with the cells and their connections and that would be that but actually there are     
22:13     
these functional interdependencies that are quite important so that's why we're interested in the sort of uh hypergraph     
22:21     
approach so that's that's you know kind of talking about that they talk about     
22:27     
the uh sort of the different types of life stages ecologies and morphologies     
22:32     
that we see in the in unisol relatives of animals and this highlights why none of     
22:39     
the single lineages could be considered as a proxy to reconstruct the unicellular ancestor of animals each of     
22:47     
these lineages as the result of millions years of evolution and they less diverged from our common     
22:52     
ancestor what we see today is their extent morphology in their current techological Niche which be quite     
22:58     
different from their ancestral state so what they're saying is that these model organisms that they're using can provide     
23:05     
clues as to you know what kinds of you know what the precursors of development     
23:11     
are or what the diversity of development is but it's important to remember that what we see today extent is very     
23:18     
different from what happened maybe in the evolutionary past and so we have to     
23:24     
kind of think about it in terms of you know what we see today as sort of a product of uh you know the the sort of     
23:33     
the ecological uh conditions and the philogenetic history of those     
23:40     
organisms so it's kind of interesting that you know there's some limitations to this kind of     
23:45     
approach quano     
23:55     
fluatron coytes so there there's some you know connections to what Spong you know sponges consequently colano flaguer     
24:04     
Key Systems for understanding animal orins so quano flates are probably the closest we have to animals it's a key     
24:12     
system for looking at like kind of is that outgroup to animals and seeing kind     
24:17     
of what maybe the ancestor of animals and clop fluent shared because they will     
24:23     
have kind of a similarity at least at that level     
24:28     
um and so yeah if you rely uniquely on quop flates you can have problems there's some issues with Gene loss uh in     
24:37     
UK carots so you know you lose genes in UK carots from that common ancestor so a     
24:42     
lot of the things we see in UK carots today are they're going to be very different from what we see in Quant of     
24:48     
flues can we you know can we sort of glean those uh common ancestral lessons     
24:55     
I don't really know maybe not um so there are a lot of uh caveats to     
25:01     
this approach but there are also a lot of benefits and you can look at some of these things in the genetic     
25:07     
developmental toolkit so one way to test whether these multicellular behaviors are related to     
25:14     
animal developed is to assess the origins of genetic developmental toolkits many of the important highly     
25:21     
conserved developmental genes were previously hypothesized to be specific to animals an exclusive patrimonium of     
25:28     
the metazoan genetic toolkit so this this genetic toolkit are the the set of     
25:33     
genes that are used in metazoans to characterize development so you get     
25:39     
these certain genes that do certain things there are these Gene networks that get put together that do certain     
25:45     
things and there's this timing of development that is conserved across a     
25:51     
lot of animals and is just kind of modified in evolution so this is the     
25:57     
kind of you know the kind of thing that we're kind of interested in and maybe you know interested in in in protests as     
26:04     
well maybe they have sort of maybe not that whole genetic toolkit or precursors     
26:10     
of the genetic toolkit so when we say genetic toolkit we're talking about things like uh     
26:16     
transcription factors that are involved in things like Master regulation of embryonic     
26:22     
development so many transcription factors are considered the master Regulators of embryonic development     
26:28     
meaning that they play a specific role in embryonic development and they play a top- down role in other words they     
26:34     
enforce embryonic development or they enforce timing mechanisms and other     
26:40     
types of regulatory information so one could argue because     
26:45     
of that key role in this genetic toolkit that the origin should be at the     
26:53     
same time as the origin of embryonic development so you know one might think that this is necessary for embryonic     
26:59     
development thus we should see this genetic toolkit immediately once devel     
27:05     
embryonic development arises in evolution but if you know we have if we     
27:10     
don't see this in protests then maybe at least we can see some precursors to this infs and that's     
27:17     
kind of the idea here the same argument could be made with genes involved in cell signaling or cell adhesion all     
27:25     
functions essential for multicellularity now when we're talking about cell signaling and cell adhesion     
27:31     
now we're talking about those precursor genes that don't involve necessarily timing or you know top- down regulation     
27:40     
but the sorts of things that cells need to live in these multicellular Aggregates they need cell adhesion genes     
27:46     
they need cell signaling and that's one of the essential features of multicellularity whether it's it you     
27:54     
know multicellularity in terms of having this different roles in a Collective or     
27:59     
whether it's transient but are these metol and developmental genes specific to animals     
28:05     
and that's the question uh during the last decade genome sequencing of several of the     
28:11     
closest Unos cellular relatives of animals lowed for a systematic reassessment of the uniqueness of the     
28:17     
metazone genetic toen so far the Genome of four quano Flags one vastan six eosp     
28:26     
orans and one Coral kitan have been sequenced providing a tax andrich     
28:31     
evolutionary perspective and the citations are here we won't get into the     
28:37     
citations but what came as a surprise was to discover that these species already had a considerable repertoire of     
28:43     
genes and Gene families involved cell adhesion cell signaling and transcriptional regulation shared with     
28:51     
animals including several genes that had previously been thought to be animal specific so it's that's interesting     
28:58     
because we might think of like the main Hallmark of development as being this     
29:04     
genetic uh this sort of Master genetic regulation and that is important for a     
29:12     
lot of the sort of the timing of develop but sort of the core of like you know     
29:17     
things like cell signaling adhesion and other types of transcriptional Regulation is actually found in uh     
29:26     
protests and maybe doesn't come as a surprise because those genes maybe arise     
29:32     
before they're organized into a toolkit but um anyways they're able to     
29:37     
find those genes and Gene families in protests and they're shared with     
29:44     
animals so these genomic resources demonstrated the last common ancestor of animals must have inherited many of     
29:51     
these genes as they evolved in unicellular context so they were around in the unicellular context and and then     
29:58     
became relevant in multicellularity became relevant in     
30:04     
development so they continue to talk about this uh     
30:10     
you know sort of the way that this relationship works so overall this     
30:15     
suggests that the unicellular ancestors were pre-equipped to perform animal- likee developmental processes so they     
30:22     
had the tools before the developmental processes the genetic tool     
30:28     
so that's actually again not maybe not a surprise you in order to get these sort     
30:34     
of functions these functional sort of Milestones you have to have things in     
30:39     
place so they had the genes and then those genes maybe were put together in     
30:45     
the networks and you end up with developmental processes so that's kind     
30:51     
of one interesting point this also raises a key question if these     
30:56     
unicellular relatives of animals are genetically pre-equipped for development then how does that translate into a     
31:02     
unicellular lifestyle in other words why didn't we see a predominance of     
31:08     
Developmental modes in protests why don't we see protests being like this     
31:14     
these very comple you know exhibiting complex multicellularity all the time why don't we have this developmental     
31:21     
tool kit developmental genetic toolkit in protests we actually don't see that     
31:26     
we see a lot of UNIS cellularity we see a lot of transient multicellular and so why don't we see     
31:33     
the same thing in protests that we see in animals there are two main models to     
31:38     
explain the origin of animal development one involves considering animal Origins as a big jump only made possible by a     
31:46     
specific combination of biological features coming together that's what I was describing when I was talking about     
31:52     
the genetic toolkit sort of being you know kind of selected for or getting the     
31:58     
together from things that are already in the genome and then putting them together in the networks which is you     
32:04     
know an evolutionary innovation in animals and that would ex that would     
32:09     
sort of require that to be in the animal clay or maybe early in the animal CL but     
32:15     
in the animal CL uh this big jump was only made     
32:21     
possible by a specific combination of biological features coming together the other is a more parimon     
32:28     
explanation in which the unicellular ancestor and the relatives of animals that diverged from ancestors so these     
32:35     
are uh you know early in well it's in unicellularity and then of course you     
32:40     
have unicellular relatives of animals that diverged from that ancestor     
32:46     
underwent some sophisticated and coordinated morphogenetic processes that could be potentially homologous to     
32:53     
animal developmental processes so in other words you would have sort sort of this precursor of development in     
32:59     
unicellular organisms that was this sort of you know set of coordinated     
33:05     
morphogenetic processes so it wasn't really development as we know it in     
33:10     
animals but it was set of a set of analogous um developmental processes and     
33:17     
then in unicellular animals that was refined upon and became the kind of     
33:24     
diversity of development we see today in animals that's a possibility as     
33:29     
well to test these ideas we need to deepen our understanding of unicellular     
33:34     
hones the idea this idea challenges our perception of the uniqueness of animal development perhaps providing a more     
33:41     
plausible scenario for the origin of animal development you know the rest of the     
33:46     
paper kind of goes through more specific stuff there are some images some uh figures here so figure two shows kind of     
33:54     
uh you know these comparable developmental processes in protestan Holo versus animals so you have these     
34:02     
four different modes of what we might call development in quotes uh the first is H sparo fora uh     
34:12     
ganocy cellularization where you get a single cell here on the left it forms this     
34:19     
multicellular Collective the multicellular or like maybe a kind of a     
34:24     
centium that forms a set of cells or cell cellularization and then there's this     
34:30     
sort of pattern formation that goes on and then that forms sort of a Spore and then their     
34:37     
cells in the Spore and then they kind of give birth to new cells so there's this sort of transient multicellularity in a     
34:47     
that you know has several steps to it which requires you know pattern     
34:52     
formation aggregation of cells and adhesion     
34:58     
in B we have this drop ential blastoderm of course which is where you have so uh     
35:04     
this blastoderm layer that's sential meaning that they're multiple     
35:12     
uh nuclei in a single cell body and so this is where you get the sential     
35:17     
blastoderm formed and of course this is kind of reminiscent of a maybe there's     
35:23     
some sort of uh evolutionary precursor to this sential Blaser that you know     
35:30     
that ROP is using but basically this is the classic example sential     
35:36     
blast uh C is uh Co Coan cooa Colony     
35:42     
inversion which is so this is again in protests where you get the feeding stage     
35:47     
where you have bacteria coming down to these organisms with Vella they kind of come together in     
35:54     
this feeding stage where the bacteria and then they have this other stage of life life history stage swimming where     
36:02     
they kind of semi disperse and they're kind of swimming together and bacteria they're kind of moving their lella     
36:09     
together to get food so there's this Colony inversion that happens that are these life cycle     
36:16     
stages and then finally animal gastrulation where you have this sort     
36:23     
of uh this shape here and then and it's folds inward which is this gastrulation     
36:31     
so this is sort of the first one of the first movements of animal development where you get this folding Inward and so     
36:39     
there's this there are these different movements uh that occur that are sort of     
36:44     
analogous between uh you know our protus and our     
36:49     
animals and so this is kind of something they find interesting that you know there are some analogies here in terms     
36:56     
of the morphology and analogies in terms of the genetic uh     
37:02     
underpinnings of this as well okay so that's pretty much the     
37:08     
paper there's some interesting references here especially if you're interested in this     
37:13     
comparative Anatomy this comparative developmental approach so that's sort of a an approach     
37:22     
you know a theoretical approach that's comparative that asks the question you     
37:27     
know can we find the precursors of development in closely related clades to     
37:33     
animals and so I think they had some interesting things there I'm not sure they really came to a solid conclusion I     
37:39     
think they they found some interesting things by just kind of reviewing the evidence for sort of the     
37:46     
genomic evidence and then some of the morphological evidence but I think those kind of approaches are very hard because     
37:53     
you know a you're kind of looking across a wide cloth of animal diversity and so     
38:00     
finding the sort of the lessons there is hard and then also you know you have     
38:05     
again whatever is extent today whatever is living doesn't represent the     
38:10     
evolutionary history so we can only assume that if two organisms that are evolutionarily related share something     
38:18     
that they had to share it in the common ancestor when in fact it could also be that they evolved     
38:24     
convergently or that there are a lot of intermediate in interm mediary steps that we don't really understand and so     
38:30     
it may look like the same thing but it's may be not the same thing and then of course with genomic     
38:37     
evidence we can make more I think focused statements about these     
38:42     
evolutionary toolkits and you know how they you know they're precursors and how they came to be in     
38:48     
different contexts well we still run into this problem of we're looking across a wide swath of animal diversity     
38:56     
so genes can can duplicate they can you know get lost they can change their     
39:01     
function etc etc so it's kind of a hard thing to uh kind of a hard method to     
39:08     
sort of get a good answer so the second paper is from     
39:14     
biological theory in 2011 this is about maybe 10 years old uh but I found it an     
39:21     
interesting paper um this is called animal development an open-ended segment     
39:26     
of life um this is by alisandra Manelli um and so the abstract here     
39:33     
reads no comprehensive theory of development as available yet other theories of development but whatever uh     
39:40     
traditionally we regard the development of animals as a sequence of changes through which an adult multicellular     
39:47     
animal is produced so again you know we talked about the sort of the sequence of     
39:52     
events that need to be there of life history events you go from like a a     
39:57     
sort of an you know a very generic form to something more specific that's kind     
40:03     
of how he's defining development and you saw this with not just with the animals     
40:08     
but you saw some examples of protests where you have these stages and then those stages have this defel this     
40:15     
genetic control um and so that's that's kind of what he's getting at     
40:21     
here a sequence of changes through which an adult multicellular animal is produced starting with a single cell     
40:27     
which is usually a fertilized egg they're increasingly complex stages however many phenomena that would     
40:34     
not qualifies is developmental according to these criteria one nevertheless qualifies Developmental and that they     
40:41     
imply non-trivial EG non degenerative changes of form so you know this is interesting     
40:48     
because if you have degenerative changes of form that doesn't really apply you     
40:53     
can have sequences of change they have to be sort of uh non-trivial and I guess     
40:59     
generative and so that's interesting but also that you know you could have uh     
41:06     
things that qualify as develop that aren't developmental so for example there might be changes in the adult that     
41:13     
would qualify as developmental by these criteria that aren't really considered     
41:19     
development so what do we kind of consider development what are the bounds of that     
41:25     
Etc uh AB broad comparative approach is badly needed and as we talked about in the     
41:31     
last paper there's this comparative approach where we look across uh taxa and we you know see     
41:38     
what's shared what's not shared and what the precursors might be or a sa like uh     
41:44     
developmental toolkit in then nidaria for example even     
41:49     
the boundary between Generations is problematic describing their life cycle in terms of metagenesis or alteration     
41:57     
between pop generation and Medusa generation and this is a thing about narian life history they have this life     
42:04     
cycle where you know you get in some organisms of course they're very good for studying development in other     
42:10     
organisms you know you have for example you have sort of an embryonic stage and     
42:16     
then you have maybe like a larval stage in other organisms you have multiple life history stages like in     
42:23     
in in SE squirts where you have this sort of sessile stage it's motile stage you have     
42:30     
different stages like that where they they actually do different types of things in different stages     
42:37     
there um sometimes a lot of these different uh     
42:44     
you know distinctions that we make though are matters of semantics more than biology so we try to characterize     
42:49     
the biology with language that we have with the observations we have it doesn't necessarily match what's actually     
42:56     
happening in the biology um the life cycle of other mezones     
43:03     
described in the textbooks in terms of larva do adult morphogenesis so this is where this this more classic sort of     
43:10     
life cycle uh where we go from like an embryo to a larva to an adult or an     
43:16     
embryo to a juvenile period to an adult is hardly different from the typical     
43:21     
metagenic life cycle in narian so what he's doing is he's drawing this distinction or this this     
43:27     
sort of comparison between nigarian life cycles which are actually quite diverse     
43:34     
and quite striking in their differences between one another with this sort of     
43:41     
adult you know larva to adult metamorphosis that you see in in other in in animals uh this applies     
43:50     
to H Hol metabolis insects into Marine invertebrates like sea urchins or most     
43:55     
of the larval cells are discarded at metamorphosis so it's interesting that like in some insects and Marin     
44:02     
invertebrates a lot of the Lal cells are discarded and you get new cells that are born so you get this this some organisms     
44:10     
you get this sort of conservation across development to the adult stage so it's     
44:15     
kind of what we see in celegans we have these cells that are born they differentiate and they become the adult     
44:21     
form in some other forms of development you get cells that are born specifically     
44:27     
before the uh larval stage and then those are discarded in some sort of     
44:32     
transformational process and then you get new cells that are born for this next life cycle so this is really     
44:38     
interesting how you know if you think about like the transformation of my caterpillar or through a butterfly they     
44:45     
go into this cocoon and they get decellularized and then they're recellularized with the cells of the new     
44:51     
part of the life cycle and they they have a vastly different form as a result     
44:58     
so this is seriously it's except for the brain yeah except for the brain so but a     
45:03     
lot of the other part of the body is remodeled and so that's a very interesting kind of uh you know     
45:11     
distinction and development that you have these different types of development     
45:18     
um this uncertain temporal and these uncertain temporal and spatial boundaries of individual development are     
45:25     
also shown by the widespread lack of a strict correspondence between adult and mature     
45:31     
so you can have changes that happen in the adult uh you have plasticity for     
45:38     
example um you have you know you can have cells being born in the adult and so you know when we say mature     
45:46     
we usually mean that's the end of change so it's like we have this end of development this end point where there's     
45:52     
a sort of fixed mature stage and of course that's not enely true in the     
45:58     
adult because you do have these kind of processes that persist you have regeneration you have new cells being     
46:05     
born etc etc uh so that it's not a clear distinction there a comprehensive theory     
46:11     
of development should start with a zero principle of Developmental inertia corresponding to an     
46:18     
indeterminate local self-perpetuation of cell level Dynamics indeterminate growth scale invariance     
46:25     
segmentation and reg generation provide example of develop Dynamics close to     
46:31     
that so that's kind of what he's talking about here a zero principle of     
46:37     
Developmental inertia corresponding to an indeterminate local self-perpetuation of cell level Dynamics so we'll have to     
46:45     
get into the paper to see what he means by     
46:55     
so um so you know it's important to remember that development is not necessarily     
47:02     
preformation at one time people believe the development was sort of this preformation where you had this sort of     
47:10     
plan that was executed in development that you didn't have you know that there     
47:15     
was a sort of plan from the egg that would unfold and you know it's not to     
47:22     
say that like when people talk about developmental genes that they're talking about preformation but you know there's     
47:29     
this distinction between preformation and epig Genesis which is where you can have this generative process that     
47:36     
unfolds and that's kind of how we view development today um interestingly we still have     
47:42     
these developmental toolkits that control the tempo development so you know I mean I think in terms of theory     
47:49     
there's this sort of still this tension between preformationism and epig Genesis but     
47:55     
anyways um so you know it talks a little bit about this history of using the word     
48:01     
development in terms of what it means and then development however is likely     
48:07     
to become a controversial term whenever we are called to determine precisely the spatial and especially the temporal     
48:13     
boundaries of the phenomena to which it applies so should we speak of development in terms of a unicellular     
48:21     
organism should we speak of development like you know in yeast there actually are life history stages in terms of its     
48:30     
uh met metabolism and other things should we speak about yeast is having a developmental     
48:36     
period sometimes they exhibit transient multicellularity should we talk about     
48:41     
that as a developmental stage Bradley there there's also the     
48:47     
question of single cell morphogenesis yeah which you datom and ciliates     
48:53     
Etc uh which can be quite complex and that's generally not addressed or     
48:59     
brought into the uh picture yeah yeah so people don't really     
49:04     
I mean they kind of think of development in this way that's kind of constraining because we don't talk about single cell     
49:11     
development really at all but it it of course exists it exists it's unexplored right     
49:18     
terms of that understanding it yeah so yeah I mean I would say it's     
49:25     
legitimate to speak of development as in unicellular organisms we just saw examples in protus where that's kind of     
49:31     
the case we can draw at least parallells in that area and then we have single cell morphogenesis as dick said so or     
49:40     
sometimes you know we think about isometri growth which are growth without changes in form so that means that     
49:46     
sometimes you know you have to think about an organism growing from a very small form to a very large form growth     
49:53     
is actually you know it requires changes in sort of the size of the organism and     
50:01     
there's this scaling that you know isometric scaling that happens so that everything scales with it but that     
50:06     
growth is part of development as well is that an aspect of development yeah yeah     
50:12     
the sensial algae are a good example of that where you can get Kelps that are 100 meters     
50:20     
long but one cell yeah so that's isometric rowth of a     
50:25     
single cell you know the wheeler yeah if not does any slight deviation     
50:33     
from isometry ter growth into a developmental process and all this so there are all sorts of questions and how     
50:39     
people view development and so this is kind of you know getting into the semantics of the terms like we talked     
50:45     
about in the last paper um so really you know we we can expect that any theory of     
50:51     
development will eventually incorporate mechanisms responsible for non-t     
50:57     
e non degenerative changes of form mainly based on changes in gene expression substantially more important     
51:04     
than the accompanying metabolism so that means that you have this these changes in gene expression that trigger sort of     
51:11     
these new changes in form that are significant and so that's kind of an     
51:18     
interesting way to view it I don't really know how you would operationalize that but it's kind of um I guess it's     
51:24     
like you know you maybe have new genes turned on for a new process to arise or something like     
51:30     
that um so they kind of go through some comparative evidence from A diversity of     
51:37     
animal taxa that may help in conceiving the development of conceiving development is other than simply the way     
51:44     
an egg is turned into an adult eventually we may hope to bring together a set of defining Criterion for     
51:50     
developmental dynamics that will minimize controversy and categorizing and explaining the biology of organ isms     
51:57     
other than humans or vertebrates gener so he he goes through this thing about what development is not which is     
52:03     
kind of interesting because it kind of I mean and he may not be right on these     
52:09     
but it kind of goes through some of the things from all these different taxa that we see you know you know kind     
52:17     
of defining the limits of development so it is usually taken for granted that development is a sequence     
52:23     
of changes through which a multicellular adult has produced they an increas in complexity more or     
52:29     
less strictly programmed in its genes starting from a single cell which in most instances is a fertilized egg     
52:36     
however broads scope comparison of diversity of living beings will easily show that such a narrow view will leave     
52:42     
out the consideration of many phenomena that for reasons mentioned deserve to be treated under the common term     
52:48     
development so you know he talks about uh how you know there are different     
52:55     
there are some views of development as sort of this uh genotype to phenotype     
53:01     
map uh which is maybe inadequate for discussing development because it's just     
53:06     
kind of mapping genes to very restrictive set of changes that we     
53:11     
consider to be development instead I will argue that development is one not restricted to the multicellular     
53:18     
organisms two does not necessarily start from an egg three does not necessarily start from a single cell four does not     
53:25     
necessarily imply an increase in structural complexity and five does not necessarily end with the achievement of     
53:31     
sexual maturity and so he goes through some of these different examples where you     
53:38     
see um you know ex sort of exceptions to the typical sort of view of     
53:45     
development um so it goes through these um and a lot     
53:51     
of this is you know just kind of examples maybe they're edge cases Maybe     
53:56     
they're really kind of um you know things that we should really kind of     
54:02     
incorporate into a theory of development but these these examples exist and so if you're going to build a theory of     
54:08     
development it's you know needed you need to have as inclusive of theory is     
54:14     
possible so um let's     
54:21     
see so it goes through all these points um trying to see if there are any sort     
54:28     
of figures in the paper then he says what development     
54:34     
possibly is so he talks about a zero condition of developing systems so in     
54:39     
mechanics the principle of inertia states that in the absence of forces applied to it the material point will     
54:45     
maintain forever its condition of rest or of uniform rectal linear motion but     
54:51     
the phenomena which we're actually interested in is are not those of inertial behavior but driving from the     
54:57     
most different deviations of inertia in biology an inertial system is a population in Hardy wind work Liber so     
55:06     
we going from mechanics and this metaphor to biology talking about like     
55:12     
the population so cardi weberg equilibrium     
55:18     
is a condition which is not so interesting per se as it is instead any deviation from it in the same vein I     
55:25     
recently advoc at a corresponding principle in developmental biology the principle of Developmental inertia     
55:32     
According to which the zero condition of development is an indeterminate local self-perpetuation of cell- level     
55:39     
Dynamics so I guess that's kind of where you have the sort of     
55:44     
aggregate that is self-perpetuating and you know so this is something that     
55:51     
doesn't need any sort of outside uh input um     
55:57     
the most General possibly fundamental of these Dynamics is arguably the sequence of mitotic in interphase events     
56:03     
comprising the cell cycle so the cell cycle is self-perpetuating this is kind     
56:08     
of the thing that you need kind of for development is this cell cycle and that's internal to the cell     
56:17     
you may also have these other types of events that are multi- solar so recently a zero model of     
56:24     
purported universality has been suggested by mshan Brandon as biology's first law according to this principle     
56:31     
the default behavior of any evolving system irrespective of selection or other cause acting on it is a steady     
56:38     
Trend towards in increasing complexity and diversity it may be useful to briefly compare this model with the     
56:44     
concept I suggesting here as a zero model for developmental Dynamics there are important differences indeed between     
56:51     
the two principles so he talks about McShay and Brandon and their biology's first law     
56:58     
and thenes as well more important however is the fact that the principle     
57:03     
I'm advocating here has the nature of an empirical generalization while McShan     
57:09     
Brandon present their biologies ver law as a universal law of nature     
57:15     
um animal animal examples of systems better approaching default developmental     
57:21     
conditions are the sponges and the Hydra where the archeocytes and the intestinal     
57:27     
cells inter no the interstitial cells respectively are responsible for an     
57:32     
intermed indeterminant ability to proliferate so this is where you have the sort of cell cycle running and this     
57:40     
is a developmental condition where you can proliferate um you know without sort of     
57:45     
a a limit to the number of cells that could be produced number another example     
57:50     
is provided by the planarians where the neoblast can comprise up to 30% of the total number of cells the adult so it     
57:57     
means that the boundaries of development are you know if we Define development as these kind of zero conditions the     
58:04     
boundaries of development can be quite different in terms of where where the stopping point is um and what what's     
58:11     
considered to be developed uh it talks about indeterminate growth and scale     
58:16     
invariance which of course is related to growth and you know talking a little bit     
58:22     
about how that can vary across the life history so it's not just restricted to     
58:27     
this developmental perod it can persist across adulthood as well and so what do     
58:34     
we really mean by development if we use like some of these sort of zero conditions these fundamental mechanisms     
58:42     
it can be quite messy you know what development is but he gets into a     
58:47     
discussion about developmental modules which is this idea that they're specific     
58:52     
you know sets of genes or specific phenotypic uh like     
58:57     
compartments that are developmentally unique or developmentally relevant and so it kind of talks about     
59:05     
that a little bit um and so you know you have to specify these     
59:10     
modules and he talks a little bit about the diversity of modules across the tree     
59:16     
of life and um so that and then gets into     
59:22     
this idea of segments regeneration     
59:28     
and then ends with these conclusions which are kind of like summarizing but he's arguing that     
59:36     
there's this set of zero principles corresponding to an ideal not period uh     
59:42     
periodized iteration of local cellular Dynamics to be sure in the actual developmental schedule of the living     
59:48     
organism there is more often much more than such an elementary Behavior but this does not mean that the actual     
59:54     
development schedules must be we necessarily start with the egg or with fertilization and necessarily ending the     
1:00:01     
last fertile gam is eventually spawned by the adult so it means that you know     
1:00:07     
you can't say that development ends at any one point it's not just about say     
1:00:14     
reproduction it's about these Su zero conditions that very widely across     
1:00:21     
tax so let me put the citation in the chat     
1:00:27     
go ahead yeah Bradley you might want to look at this paper but just see if you can tear it apart okay so this is are we     
1:00:35     
on the cusp of a new paradigm for biology the oh this is the Janice face paper but this is a is this the one     
1:00:43     
with uh Rob stone or is this a different one no this this is just me okay the     
1:00:50     
logic of molecular developmental biology versus Janice face control of embryogenesis     
1:00:56     
okay I'll I'll have to take a look at that and we'll maybe talk about it next week yeah it it it gives a contrast to     
1:01:05     
you see both papers seem that you talked about seem to be Gene oriented yeah in     
1:01:10     
other words there's an assumption that the genes are what's in     
1:01:16     
control okay and uh it may be     
1:01:22     
wrong yeah so yeah the I think I think yeah I think there is a sort of people     
1:01:29     
you know that they've really become enamored by a lot of the genomic evidence and certainly for doing     
1:01:35     
comparative work you know you kind of have to go there because it's like showing where sort of the precursors     
1:01:42     
that's the way the Lemmings all ran yeah yeah yeah you don't have to go just that     
1:01:50     
way right right but uh you know I mean     
1:01:56     
you know for example uh if you looked at mitotic mechanisms you could do a     
1:02:01     
whole uh classification of organisms based on the mitotic org mechanisms and     
1:02:07     
it might be different from the gene oriented ones right yeah okay so uh you     
1:02:13     
know as I say the lemings all go One Direction that's that's where the money     
1:02:18     
is yeah yeah it's kind of like in uh in     
1:02:23     
biogenetics when we're looking at evolutionary relationships we'll often have like a genan tree and we'll have     
1:02:29     
some tree based on like some orological characteristics they often aren't like compatible you know you have to have a     
1:02:35     
consensus tree or because they're not the same they don't really track you know directly you often have a lot of     
1:02:43     
different I think in much of this uh the uh the general ideas are follow the     
1:02:50     
money yeah probably probably fundamental uh uh     
1:02:59     
basis for biology yeah that's the biology zero     
1:03:05     
with law I guess well yeah yeah those who get grants get     
1:03:14     
grants and those who get the grants don't allow people with other ideas to     
1:03:19     
get the grants so you know it's a uh science is a very strange uh beast in     
1:03:25     
this regard very too too much positive feedback     
1:03:31     
yeah so uh any rate you might you might want to do something on this paper     
1:03:39     
and and as I said tear it apart okay all right yeah sure Jesse     
1:03:48     
would agree Jesse says too much positive feedback yes those who get money get     
1:03:55     
money I think therefore the ideas they push     
1:04:02     
are the ones that uh get published     
1:04:07     
yeah there's some things I'm working on in that space that I'll I'll say more later about they're not     
1:04:16     
really yeah I'm definitely yeah um and     
1:04:21     
also uh the the all the papers I know I came in late to the new meeting but even the one the one that ni shared in the     
1:04:30     
chat um and some other ones like I I want to go back and look at the paper that you just went over like I kind of     
1:04:36     
caught like I had to step out again even after you did it so it was all really cool stuff but thank you for sharing     
1:04:42     
those things welcome man a lot of the scientific names of the organisms are a bit hard to say if     
1:04:50     
you're not familiar with them so yeah they don't make it easy     
1:04:56     
in animal tax on or in biological tax on me in general this is like kind     
1:05:03     
of these long latinesque names that's     
1:05:12     
like I think that's it for today thank you Pocky for demon for demonstrating your gso project good luck with the     
1:05:20     
submission and um see you next week     
1:05:25     
okay have a good week all right thanks bye bye
