can't get console to to um simulate a complex Tegrity only a u only a triangle     
0:09     
it'll only do a triangle not sure what's up with it oh     
0:15     
okay okay Bradley uh uh Ken Chan and I finished that paper okay uh so uh it     
0:23     
hasn't been submitted yet uh I could do a presentation on it I guess well when     
0:28     
you're ready yeah that's sounds great it sounds great why don't you go ahead and do that okay no not uh well not today     
0:35     
maybe next week all right so what paper is this this is the paper on reconstructing an image from a set of     
0:42     
lines across it oh okay oh wow you you're you've got that yeah it     
0:50     
works wow okay it's it's amazing it's a it's a     
0:56     
it's a Prelude to another paper where we make the lines x-rays but right now we're just trying to use     
1:02     
lines that's great okay yeah     
1:07     
so okay okay I'll put together something uh we we have 90 pictures I have to     
1:13     
reduce them for a presentation oh yeah yeah gotta select this okay     
1:20     
yeah well any rate uh it was fun working with him he he's straight out of high     
1:26     
school okay he didn't know anything about image processing and he learned and he he knew some     
1:32     
python okay he learned how to do image processing in Python in three months I     
1:38     
guess and uh and was able to come come through with some fairly complicated     
1:43     
stuff really pushed his high school algebra wow so but he's in college now so that's     
1:52     
the end of that collaboration for a while     
1:57     
yeah so yeah that's great yeah yeah it's based on a a strange     
2:04     
observation and that is uh if you look at x-rays they come out either in a cone     
2:10     
beam or if you colonate them into a fan beam and there are thousands of papers     
2:17     
on how to make images from them but there isn't a single paper on how to     
2:22     
make an image if you go to a onedimensional beam     
2:28     
right okay so uh any rate this will be the first     
2:37     
yeah so it looks like oh yeah it's very strange yeah suan might     
2:46     
be able to turn it into tense Equity structures I don't     
2:51     
know yeah if they it would work I'm I'm was told to use mat lab     
2:58     
because it's just very straight forward you using matrices and you can kind of     
3:03     
see what's going on so I'm going to try that next I'm next yeah I've kind of got     
3:12     
some images of what console produces and then I have some other     
3:19     
other papers about other programs and there's even some online that that     
3:25     
work for um um     
3:30     
modeling um modeling meta materials and then modeling penties and other things     
3:38     
and um what's called grasshopper anyway     
3:44     
okay um so I'm I don't know um there uh     
3:50     
look up I just recall the name of it there's another program which I think is free it's called push me pull me oh     
3:58     
that's it yeah thank you yeah I was going to ask if you could remember that for me yeah I just just I'm having     
4:05     
trouble getting a hold of that well this is I haven't had any experience with it for a couple years so     
4:12     
it could be that it's not available anymore well um I ran into roadbox like     
4:18     
it it I can't download it if it's on um what is it Google     
4:27     
um Gmail no um Chrome yeah so Chrome won't download     
4:34     
it and then um others other things just     
4:40     
well it just bogs I can't I can't access it huh oh it's     
4:47     
blocked Brave pardon have you tried brave brave yeah yeah that's what I'm on     
4:56     
it's a it's a it's b r a v e it's a it's another     
5:02     
uh uh what do you call it it's a web browser     
5:09     
yeah huh okay well um yeah I'm having trouble with what is it uh this other     
5:18     
one uh Microsoft Edge that's it won't let me into     
5:24     
it I don't know if you it's because it has is     
5:30     
Javascript and I downloaded the Java     
5:36     
and I don't know huh anyways not working     
5:41     
can't get into push me pull you which is specifically um built to do 10     
5:49     
seges which is probably what I need to try out my models yeah you got an     
5:54     
example right here bed is trapped in a tensity structure yeah     
6:01     
actually this is something no trash you're not trapped isn't a big     
6:08     
sper about to eat you huh yeah it's kind of something     
6:15     
like you can say this is oh     
6:21     
yeah I'm in the southern part of Iran and the r is some some     
6:32     
hot and I'm in balcony right now okay here it's only minus     
6:41     
20 not our problem anyway yeah that looks like a     
6:48     
nice structure behind you yeah yes got all the features different flexible     
6:57     
Parts if you are interested to that's what it like oh yeah and he yeah     
7:04     
if he tries to escape you'll see the     
7:13     
forces great said anyway I'll I'll shut off my     
7:20     
um ohy room oh     
7:25     
yeah because it helps with bandwidth so okay yeah yeah yeah so welcome to the     
7:32     
meeting this is the first meeting of 2024 so I hope everyone had a good uh New Year you know holiday season and got     
7:40     
to rest a little bit and um so yeah I'm glad Susan's getting back into the swing     
7:46     
of uh tensegrity sounds like a lot of challenges coming up on that GL dick was     
7:54     
able to it's just it's simply a headache when you try to use something like     
7:59     
console with it because it just it won't compute won't settle down it says that     
8:06     
if the iteration error is less than 10-4 than it's     
8:13     
stable and my graph the graphs of the error show that it is below 10 the minus     
8:20     
14 but it won't settle down so yeah I don't think I either have     
8:28     
to change the formulas in console so that they will do T seg or I need to     
8:35     
find another program right yeah I that's my     
8:42     
conclusion well that sounds like yeah sounds like fun uh yeah I'm glad to hear dick has     
8:49     
got that problem in hand and we talked about that last year oh he's been     
8:54     
looking at it for a while actually     
9:01     
um so i' I've been looking at it for too long um and uh I was more or less     
9:11     
ordered to quit using console and do something else and I'm going can I quit     
9:17     
now right now yeah so yeah so welcome vit uh how are     
9:26     
you doing this this year yeah I'm fine and happy New Year to you as well I hope     
9:33     
you you have a great year this yeah uh actually I was going to because this is     
9:39     
my second session that's I'm coming in raow I guess uh I was going to ask if     
9:45     
there's anything I could do with uh I could actually participate in and have a     
9:52     
uh maybe uh to take part in your conversations every week uh with a     
9:58     
better background or if there could be anything I could be participated to I would be happy uh to     
10:05     
let me know okay yeah I mean there are a lot of things that we're doing on a regular     
10:12     
basis it's just uh whatever interests you uh we haven't done a an overview of     
10:19     
things in a while um so there are a lot of things that you know I want to make     
10:24     
it worth your time you know to do things uh but I yeah I don't I'm not prepared     
10:31     
to launch into a big presentation now about like what all things we have outstanding but yeah I would definitely     
10:38     
like to have you like you know you could even like just present on what you're     
10:44     
working on for I know you're working on some things with uh you know ion channels and things     
10:50     
like that or other things that you're working on you're free to present that too it might fit into something we're     
10:56     
doing so oh okay actually as you said I've been more     
11:04     
focused on the iron Channel models and during the past years in uh the open one     
11:10     
project uh but recently I've been uh more uh trying to focus on a broader     
11:18     
approach to um to network and system models but on the other hand because I'm     
11:24     
actually trying to uh have EV an evolution uh     
11:29     
uh actually point of view to what I'm working on uh I'm I would be happy to     
11:36     
get the uh so different stage of the development of the world one     
11:41     
particularly one uh reason is that uh I'm more interested in uh to see how the     
11:49     
maybe how the brain of a worm could develop during different states and how     
11:55     
it could become more complicated from some     
12:01     
uh I can say from an engineering point of view because I have some background in engineering as well I let me see say     
12:08     
from the beginning I have a bachelor in computer engineering I have a studied a     
12:15     
master in Biochemistry or biology with Fus on biochemistry and during my thesis     
12:20     
I was working on the open world then I started another uh actually this second     
12:26     
master this first master was going to be continued uh in a lab in     
12:33     
uh after some discussion we had uh in one of the labs at stample but it didn't     
12:40     
happen at that time so I started another master in mecatronics over here again uh     
12:47     
my second master mecatronics was mainly focused on uh the I can say the uh the     
12:55     
electrical circuits they uh and uh how they could be and different applications     
13:02     
of uh our simulation models in uh in somehow from an engineering engineering     
13:09     
point of view so I'm so interested now to see how a simple model of neural     
13:15     
networks in a simple brain like uh maybe we can say uh at the very beginning of     
13:24     
development of a of a wor like C could be uh somehow uh be developed to be a     
13:32     
more complex one like a Elegance in 20 days and after that what happen if is     
13:41     
actually uh is going to be more complex uh maybe some other animals and     
13:50     
the humankind on the other hand I'm somehow interesting the application of     
13:55     
those models uh from we can say in different diseases as I said like     
14:02     
channelopathies like uh a lot of diseases that uh iron channels espe     
14:08     
especially are uh including and there are two main uh I     
14:15     
can say uh studies I'm these days I'm more uh     
14:21     
involving and would be happy to uh to co     
14:27     
with you at anything you are actually doing your uh maybe I'm I'm seeing that     
14:35     
you are so active in uh reading and studying different papers every week and     
14:41     
maybe summarizing those papers I would be happy to collaborate on that as well     
14:47     
and any other suggestion that could be possibly uh     
14:54     
you yeah that sounds great um so yeah we we've we have an interest in doing     
14:59     
things with like the development of the brain and things like that that would be great to to focus on to see if you know     
15:06     
you could gain some insights from that and one more thing that I've been     
15:12     
actually looking into was a comparison between artificial neural networks and biological neural neural networks and     
15:19     
this is something that is really interesting from an evolutionary point of view and also from a from a     
15:25     
developmental point of view as you know uh you try to uh try to analyze or build     
15:34     
some uh some electrical C from the beginning you you can get a lot of idea     
15:40     
from how it has been developed from a biological point of view and and this     
15:46     
something that already happened uh during the development of artificial neuron networks so I'm a little uh more     
15:54     
interested in in that topic focusing on that with your collaboration maybe and uh     
16:03     
yeah and I can say uh and one more thing     
16:09     
that these days I'm also looking for a PhD program that uh maybe I could be     
16:16     
more get focused on uh on all these uh topics so I hope during the the other     
16:24     
four to five years I uh would be more focused on all all everything I've been discussing     
16:31     
right now that sounds great that sounds great yeah there's a lot of space for that uh     
16:37     
we we actually I worked on a paper with uh someone who used to collaborate in this group uh we worked on a paper on     
16:46     
comparing artificial and biological neural networks I have to dust that off and and show you because you know it's     
16:52     
not it's kind of like you can make a point BYO comparison but I you know I     
16:58     
think there's something deeper there like you know there's some principle or some uh something that maybe biological     
17:05     
neural networks are better at or are different from in in the way that they work that makes them you know I mean it     
17:12     
seems like an artificial neural networks we have this we hit this wall of     
17:17     
understanding and things like that and so I mean you know why is that and so why are the networks and biological     
17:24     
neural networks the way they are and why do they work so well and things like     
17:29     
that um so yeah I can I would definitely also you know if there are papers you'd     
17:35     
like to review on on the topic because the reason we do that in the group is because it helps I think people think     
17:42     
about you know some of these papers sort of you know what where do they fit into     
17:47     
a lot of what we're doing you know and so that yeah please please feel free to     
17:53     
present on something if you want to bring it to the meeting and just you know it doesn't have to be formal it can can be just very     
17:59     
informal sure but if I know every week we are going to discuss any specific     
18:05     
topic I would be happy to collaborate with that topic as well okay I'm I'm not     
18:12     
sure I'm not I actually do not have any agenda or anything like that for every     
18:17     
for weekly meetings so if I if there is any specific topic that every week you     
18:22     
are going to discuss I would be happy to yeah to read some paper and uh discuss     
18:31     
yeah yeah I usually just leave it up to where it goes like I usually have some materials but then I see where we're you     
18:38     
know what fits into the week or it doesn't even matter because we can just present on something uh you a lot of     
18:45     
times like we'll do um you know during the uh Google summer code period for     
18:50     
example we'll do like presentations on like machine learning and deep learning and then we'll switch over to like     
18:57     
biology you know we biophysics so it's not you know yeah it doesn't need to be necessarily match the theme but you know     
19:05     
we we do want to get it actually we do want to get a mixture of things because it is valuable to see different     
19:10     
perspectives in and one more thing to process again to emphasize because I've been somehow     
19:19     
uh more active during some years in the past European B project and a little     
19:25     
less active during the one or two years ago but uh I was going to I'm     
19:31     
emphasizing disant I'm going to uh focus on my studies from from I started from     
19:39     
this year and it would be continued for maybe four or five years because in the     
19:44     
past I've been uh somehow uh uh I was     
19:50     
more a little busy with my job uh I've been both working and studying as well     
19:56     
but uh this year I definitely stopped     
20:01     
working and I'm just going to focus on all my research and studies from now     
20:07     
on yeah this my decision of yeah last     
20:13     
year but I'm going expion for more for four or five years so you can count on     
20:18     
me for the next four or five years definitely yeah well that's great     
20:24     
yeah yeah happy to enjo yeah yeah yeah so yeah if you need anything let me know     
20:30     
I mean if you want to coordinate something or if you want to do something uh if something really kind of gets you     
20:37     
really interested we can we can do some you know we can develop it so yeah I would be happy to and     
20:44     
especially if if my next maybe thesis would be on some like some similar     
20:50     
topics or with the collaboration of of some supervisor from the worm Community     
20:56     
from the SE community I I that would be really would uh maybe match everything     
21:03     
we are going to do so it it depends on what I'm going to work my focus on my     
21:09     
supervisor but uh definitely I would do     
21:14     
some similar topic as I said uh for for the next maybe four or five years okay     
21:21     
yeah yeah yeah it's definitely good I've had a couple people do things like that     
21:27     
where they've kind of developed things in the group and then gone on to work on them for like a graduate project or     
21:34     
something um so yeah definitely it can always tie into     
21:40     
that we' be happy to collaborate yeah okay all right thank you     
21:47     
yeah thank you for for the great time your actually     
21:54     
yeah so we had someone else David I don't know if they were just checking out the     
22:00     
meeting or what but they haven't joined back in so I     
22:05     
don't know so yeah yeah that's great so I     
22:10     
guess actually sorry to be to finish that's H if you know of any specific     
22:18     
program that would be related to everything you are talking about I would be happy to apply for the program as     
22:24     
well because I'm these days I'm applying for one or two uh related uh program for p plus PhD     
22:33     
program and so if you know of any there some supervisor with uh with some uh     
22:42     
maybe similar topics that we are discussing is looking for uh a     
22:47     
researcher SE researcher I would be happy to uh apply for that program as     
22:52     
well yeah all right I guess this is uh the last thing I was going to discuss     
22:59     
maybe I have uh you could always join APS physics     
23:09     
they do bioh physics and um soft matter physics     
23:14     
and sometimes they have uh workshops and     
23:20     
uh sometimes they have postop positions that they advertise and     
23:26     
it's you can get to know the community a bit if if you join     
23:33     
them thank you could you write the in the message in the message oh you sure     
23:41     
yeah thank you and actually I last week I applied for for a mentorship program     
23:48     
that I I I saw seon Community has been greatly working on yeah there was a list     
23:55     
of different mentors that and I saw your name under the this yeah yeah yeah the     
24:02     
only one who was actually focusing on computational neuros science of actually     
24:09     
computational biology of silons and uh if there is anyone I hope there is you or anyone     
24:17     
else could be Mentor work     
24:23     
working collaboration I registered my name under that so I'm hoping I I fin find someoneis in     
24:33     
my that is more professionally yeah yeah yeah I I I think this is something     
24:40     
that I uh signed up for like a couple months ago I I didn't know what the     
24:45     
state of it was but glad that it's happening and that you're fine yeah I     
24:51     
guess you know the SE allans Community is really you know outside of openworm     
24:56     
they really have a lot of like you know good opportunities for open data and mentorship and so you know it's like     
25:04     
it's pretty pretty well uh veryy tightly knit or I wouldn't say tightly knit but like it has a lot     
25:11     
of resources so uh yeah definitely you know participate in like a mentorship     
25:17     
program if you can and I'll I'll kind of I I'll get in touch with you about some of the things I've been taking notes     
25:23     
about some things that you might be interested in I'll send you some things on that cuz you know we've done some work on Developmental connectum and     
25:31     
there's there's a fair amount of work on that already but it's interesting because you know it's a a relatively     
25:38     
small nervous system that's well characterized but at the same time you know there are things going on there     
25:45     
development that we we don't really know uh you know what what how it works or     
25:50     
how it gets connected and how it gets put together so there there I think there are a lot of open questions there     
25:56     
it's just a matter of you know what what can we what kind of data can we get uh and what kind of     
26:02     
questions can we ask so you know there's in seans you have laral development     
26:08     
which is uh where the well we have embryogenetic development where we have     
26:13     
the cells divide and form this uh worm and it's all curled up in the egg and     
26:20     
then once it hatches you have laral development which is where it goes through a number of stages uh mols of     
26:28     
the of the cuticle and there are a lot of changes there as well a lot of uh morphogenesis of cell types uh and so     
26:36     
you know that's it's interesting we actually there actually are some data sets for larval development for the     
26:44     
brain and those are pretty useful um uh for the for the embryo not so much but     
26:52     
the embryo we have a lot of data on cell differentiation for neurons and so     
26:57     
that's that's where it's important you know important data for that so yeah go     
27:03     
ahead uh if you remember we were talking we were discussing it uh some idea in     
27:10     
the past I was working on there was an online book I I was     
27:15     
going to work on called uh Ro math book that I was going to somehow discuss the     
27:22     
different states of development of a world from day Zero to 21 something like     
27:29     
that and how it evolves through all these States from a mathematical point     
27:35     
of view if you for example design a in a     
27:40     
in a simple uh you can say in a simple form if you design an electrical circuit     
27:46     
that could handle some very basic uh actually behaviors of a b from day Zero     
27:53     
how it actually evolved during all these days and and becomes more complex and     
28:00     
could decide what to do and everything uh let me find the the the main idea of     
28:08     
the repository that I actually working on I have uh still I have some references     
28:16     
that I'm day by day adding to uh to to to that uh good as well to be able to uh     
28:26     
maybe put it in a way that could be uh     
28:32     
collabor uh work on on that as well I guess if that could happen during maybe     
28:39     
the next years that I'm going to work uh with especially with the with help of     
28:45     
someone uh who is really maybe who has a great uh background then both mathematic     
28:53     
and the biology of SE would be really great to work on this as well this is     
28:59     
one of the ideas that I'm especially from a comparison point of view between     
29:05     
a Ann and DNN so that would be a great case yeah to work and I I I would be     
29:11     
happy to work on some similar M great yeah that's actually the scale     
29:19     
of Sean's development is like hours so days is like like the whole lifespan is     
29:25     
like three days so but yeah it's it's a definitely a good problem you can break it down because the data exists people     
29:32     
have done the you know characterized everything so yeah um I just wanted to     
29:38     
say something more about the aps March meeting um the registration early     
29:45     
registration is now open and I know that um I'm going to get this name wrong um     
29:52     
merete group is uh presenting like     
29:57     
they're the active matter they're an active matter group is     
30:03     
presenting uh quite a few times at the meeting     
30:09     
yeah and there's some workshops that look interacting as well I don't know if I'll go but um I was thinking of     
30:17     
attending virtually a lot out of it yeah the year before and when I attended um     
30:28     
this this La past year um in person it it was in Los Vegas and I got sore feet     
30:37     
and sat in meetings and um took Hasty notes and it was almost better to do it     
30:44     
online where you could do occasional screen captures and and then you can     
30:49     
look things up so um it it's okay to attend virtually it it's quite     
30:56     
nice do that it's cheaper and um     
31:01     
easier you don't get the interaction with the people but     
31:08     
still yeah I um attend um the biophysics students group um meetings     
31:17     
and I got to meet those people in person so it's it's nice to meet people you've     
31:23     
met online and that some of you I would like to meet in person somay     
31:29     
yeah yeah and is there anything related to     
31:34     
the quantum phenomena that's because I they have quantum physics as a part of     
31:43     
uh the aps physics I don't know if it's related to     
31:48     
biology but yes it's all of physics that's represented by the aps physics     
31:56     
meeting uh I I I mean because as you know some uh Quantum phenomena are recently they     
32:03     
have been discussed that we have in especially in Iron chn I read some papers that Quantum phenomena could     
32:11     
affect the maybe somehow uh the trans pass of ions to through the cells     
32:18     
through the membranes and so I was really interested this day and see if there is any uh you can say uh really     
32:27     
strict uh study in in in that uh topics     
32:33     
if they're going to discuss something like that as well yeah I I don't know um all know     
32:40     
about Quantum Wells is uh in transistors so I'm sure there's an effect in biology     
32:48     
and it may have something to do with browni and mo Brownian motion um to go     
32:53     
in that direction so um yeah they have all kinds of things at this     
33:01     
APS physics meeting yeah just look it up it's like     
33:08     
you can't certainly can't attend it all     
33:14     
sure yeah we had some interesting things last year you had presented on some of it and talked about it like what you had     
33:22     
found interesting so yeah definitely a lot of soft matter physics and that I think that really     
33:29     
kind of a quite an interesting set of questions there in soft matter physics and and especially with respect to     
33:37     
development and sort of a hot topic now where people are finding these different     
33:42     
uh questions you know of kind of like you know if you have cell division you     
33:47     
have tissues that are forming you know they're they're forming sort of soft matter types of M you know they can be     
33:54     
treated as a soft matter and and you know you can then model the properties     
34:00     
of that soft matter as sort of like a you know getting a sense of what the     
34:06     
tissue is like how it behaves how it deforms and then that explains certain     
34:11     
things about development so but you know that's something that is an emerging     
34:18     
area uh you know imagine I I really haven't dug into the math of it but like     
34:25     
you know you get to apply a different models uh to you know an embryo so I     
34:33     
think I'm just going to go with a Vertex model for my epithelial tissue so people     
34:39     
already done L and just try to use     
34:50     
something because it seems to work yeah you don't need the whole     
34:57     
model the whole tissue     
35:09     
[Music]     
35:18     
acts yeah yeah we talked about the epithelial well I mean in a number of     
35:23     
papers we did last year we talked about epithelial Network and things like that so yeah yeah well brain     
35:31     
is tissue yeah     
35:37     
yeah so yeah it's it's good stuff um yeah I'll I'll get together some things     
35:42     
for veed and you can take a look at them and see and we can just shape you know     
35:48     
usually we just kind of work through things from week to week and see where we are after that and so great     
35:59     
link I     
36:07     
[Music] the     
36:13     
L yeah this is APS     
36:20     
APS okay I like bio better but is uh     
36:27     
want be S yeah this is something that maybe as they they are describing that Quantum     
36:34     
phenomena is not affecting in contrary to what I was talking about because these days I've     
36:41     
been talking to some uh people in the in the biophysics world and especially the     
36:47     
Neuroscience world uh I've been talking to Dian uh in the past and we were     
36:54     
discussing the different type of uh maybe approach to the models     
37:01     
of how NE work and one thing I've been discussing was the the effect of the     
37:09     
quantum phenomena that some people are discussing the during the past years and     
37:15     
uh actually that's this is where we're going to uh I've been decided to even to     
37:22     
apply for a biophysics program these days uh in uh maybe uh for for the next uh program     
37:31     
I I'm going to join and maybe that uh     
37:36     
context I would uh study better the the effect of uh quantum physics in the     
37:42     
world of neuros science and this is something that would be really interesting I guess     
37:51     
but yeah I'm sure there's PR I'm sure there's Arguments for against I mean     
37:57     
there's arguments born against pensity as a model system for cells so     
38:07     
great at least we know somehow that probabilistic maybe you can say the     
38:13     
probation the theories that are somehow uh working both in the quantum world and     
38:21     
uh in the mathematical model that we are using maybe that could be a good     
38:26     
starting point discuss stuff like that because lots of uh mathematical models     
38:32     
we are working on are somehow uh are working from both of     
38:39     
the yeah there's even a statistical physics     
38:44     
chapter that I I joined because they wanted me to they had the t-shirts so I     
38:51     
I tried to win a t-shirt got a tote bag instead but I joined this statistical     
39:02     
physics yeah well that's great uh thank you for     
39:09     
that discussion looks like so that's the link to the soft matter group and yeah     
39:16     
we we'll talk about this more in weeks to come uh and yeah they flush out some     
39:23     
things looks like Morgan and Jesse joined us so welcome uh hope you had a good     
39:31     
break um I'm gonna share my screen I want to talk about some things that uh     
39:40     
kind of collected I know Morgan sent me this interesting collection I want to go through that and then I want to talk     
39:45     
about a paper uh so let me share my screen     
39:51     
here so this is something Morgan sent this is a a science special issue     
39:57     
on what they call the brain cell sensus and this is another thing we've talked about in the past about like cell types     
40:05     
and we talked about that actually at the last meeting of 2023 about cell types and cell atlases and like you know     
40:12     
getting a good approximation of the number of different types of cell and you know it's you can do this in a     
40:19     
number of ways you can estimate them from you know microscopy observations you can do like next     
40:26     
sequencing profiling things like that so there are different ways people are kind of coming at this problem and the I     
40:33     
guess the answer would be to like use a bunch of different methods and get like a fair consensus around like what is the     
40:41     
number of different types of cells uh what they're doing in this collection of papers this is uh recently     
40:48     
published in science um in November 23 so this was a     
40:54     
couple months ago what they've done as they've done this brain cell census I think in humans so you know the human     
41:01     
brain has uh 86 billion neurons uh and they want to decipher the     
41:07     
genetic diversity of these neurons and so when they do that they can actually     
41:13     
then put them into different categories of you know functional category or uh     
41:19     
just kind of identity category and so the difference of course is that functional categories are you know can     
41:26     
look at functional genes you can look at just differences in genetic makeup you can look at different things like that     
41:33     
so uh this is how they're you know kind of approaching this problem and then you     
41:38     
know they come up with some sort of estimate of the different uh distributions of cell type in the brain     
41:45     
so we have under this what what this link was and I think Morgan put this in     
41:51     
in a slack as a slack link uh this was uh this is of 21 papers so this is um in     
42:00     
this collection of papers published in science science advances in science     
42:05     
translation of medicines all the science journals that they have now uh the     
42:10     
National Institute of Health brain research through advancing Innovative Technologies or their brain     
42:17     
initiative uh and then there's the cell sensus network bicn which is a part of     
42:22     
that uh presents a large scale multiomic and multi- omix is using these different     
42:29     
genomic or omic approaches to looking at usually gene     
42:36     
expression uh but with omix you sometimes also get the sequences and you can take the sequences     
42:42     
and map them to like a a draft Human Genome and or a personalized Human     
42:47     
Genome and get uh you know figure out what genes those are what     
42:53     
Loi and uh you know then you can going identify cell types that     
42:58     
way so they present a large scale multiomics analysis of the human brain at the cell type level so they're     
43:06     
looking at different cell types they're looking at the diversity within the cell type so you could have a conventional     
43:12     
cell type like uh you know like a a cerebellar you know different cells in     
43:17     
the cerebellum uh you could then look at the cells that are known to be of that     
43:23     
category and look at you know what they're expressing what genes are there that are you know being regulated in     
43:29     
different ways and so forth and so not only can you find category or you know     
43:35     
do this sort of taxonomic exercise but you can find diversity within different     
43:40     
cell types and in ways that we have can't really do with Anatomy or with microscopy so this is what they're doing     
43:48     
here so they have 21 papers uh they're producing a comprehensive cell atlas of the adult in     
43:56     
developing human brain at the transcriptional epigenetic and functional     
44:01     
levels in addition by comparing human non-human primate and rodent brains so     
44:07     
they have human brains but they also have non-human primates and they have rodents so they have this sort of     
44:14     
biogenetic uh diversity and you know this is of course just I mean I don't     
44:19     
know how much people think about this in terms of phenetics a lot of times in these kind     
44:24     
of studies they just make the compar and leave it there and say this is the difference between rat brains say and     
44:32     
human brains or Mouse brains and human brains and so that's that's not that interesting in of itself of course there     
44:39     
going to be differences but what are those differences where do they diverge from what does that mean uh functionally     
44:45     
and so forth so that's not you know that that's good that we have these different     
44:50     
uh different species models that we can look at they look across uh and so this     
44:57     
is one thing that we talked about with respect to Cell atlases last time is     
45:02     
that cell atlases don't give a good accounting of say like lineage trees or     
45:08     
you know differentiation processes or Evolution or anything like that they're     
45:13     
usually just kind of identifying things you know at from the observations and     
45:19     
maybe doing some sort of classification exercise where they're just saying this is this type of cell this type of so and     
45:26     
it differs maybe from El which is a lot of times what maybe say like a neurosci     
45:32     
if you're doing clinical Neuroscience or just sort of Behavioral Neuroscience or something like that that's what you're     
45:38     
interested in uh so that's maybe one reason why that's a priority but you     
45:43     
know that's one shortcoming of cell atlases as we talked about last     
45:49     
time uh so until now this type of analysis is mostly reserved to preclinical studies animal models the     
45:57     
results presented by the bicn show how these Technologies can now be applied at scale to tackle brain     
46:04     
complexity in humans and our close relatives this these data will allow     
46:09     
researchers to tackle a wide variety of scientific questions and are already a milestone in the neuroscientific world     
46:16     
so this is kind of getting at these you know fundable questions as they call them or fundable statements which is are     
46:24     
they they kind of give the significance uh in terms of not you know maybe not     
46:29     
practical signif well practical significance but it's like you know the     
46:34     
the sort of thing you might think of when you kind of develop something you don't really know what it is you just kind of say you know it's going to     
46:40     
improve the world or something like that uh so these are there are number of     
46:46     
papers in here this one single cell genomics reveals region specific developmental     
46:52     
trajectories so this is where they're looking at different trajectories of different parts of the brain and so     
46:59     
they're looking at neuronal diversity in the human hypothalamus so they're looking at different type parts of the hypothalamus     
47:07     
which is a part of the brain they're looking at single cell genomics and they're trying to figure out you know     
47:12     
why there's there are these different parts of the hippocampus and why you     
47:18     
know how they differentiate they don't really I don't know if they get into the question of differentiation however it's     
47:24     
just kind of identic ifying that there are these differences and then maybe the trajectory to     
47:31     
those uh there's one the Single Cell genomic Atlas for maturation of the     
47:36     
human cerebellum during early childhood so this is a developmental study where     
47:42     
they're looking at the maturation of human cerebellum um they're looking at     
47:48     
transcriptome diversity of C types across the adult human brain so they're     
47:53     
looking at how you know gen expression varies across different cell     
47:59     
types uh comparative transcriptomics which means that they're looking at the     
48:04     
transcriptome or how genes are expressed in different species this reveals human specific     
48:11     
vertical features so it's human specific as opposed to say like whatever they're comparing it with it's still not really     
48:18     
a statement of evolution it's just a statement of difference so if you want to know something about the evolution     
48:25     
you might want to do like some sort of look at the trajectory of some area     
48:30     
that's unique to humans or you know whatever and then go from there so you     
48:36     
know putting these together I think you can see that you know anyone's study isn't going to cover really what we     
48:42     
would like to see maybe in our group uh but they're kind of you know getting     
48:48     
we're putting the pieces together here uh let's see this one Morpho     
48:55     
Electric and transcriptomic Divergence of the layer one inter neuron     
49:00     
repertoire in human versus mouse neocortex so this is a comparison of     
49:06     
human and mouse this is the specific area layer one Tinder neuron this is I     
49:12     
think a neocortex this is the you know neocortex in mammals it has six layers     
49:19     
and this is layer one and so layer one then has uh you know different properties in     
49:25     
human versus mouse and you can look at that in these two ways um so you're just taking a piece a     
49:32     
part of a tissue part of a region of a tissue type and you're looking at the     
49:38     
cells there and the diversity and how they differ between     
49:43     
species uh this one's single cell analysis a prenatal and postnatal human     
49:49     
cortical development so this is where we have you know these two time points     
49:54     
prenatal and post and then you look and compare what they're expressing and so     
50:00     
you know in seans the difference there would be like if you were to look at say like a larval     
50:05     
stage or in the embryo in the epig you know in the uh embryogenetic State     
50:13     
versus maybe in the adult worm or some other maybe later laral endpoint so you     
50:18     
have two endpoints and you're comparing them um and so you know the the idea here is     
50:25     
that you would get a sense of what changes with development what is what's going on in development what's going on     
50:32     
post-development uh and so it's supposed to give you some indicator of that so yeah there are a lot of stuff on     
50:38     
development here a lot of stuff on inter individual variation so this is where     
50:44     
you look at a bunch of humans and you see what the differences are between cell type abundance and     
50:50     
expression uh and so you know you can do this in other species as well and see how we can do this with uh different uh     
50:58     
defined genetic strains so you know there is data out there in cgans for     
51:04     
different defined mutations where they have a maybe a mutation for brain     
51:10     
development or a mutation for like movement deficits and you can like you can actually get a whole catalog of     
51:17     
these defined mutants and there's a lot of data out there that's been generated on these defined mutants so you know     
51:24     
being able to compare that with a type allows you to see like where these differences you know if you knock out     
51:30     
something important like a certain Gene uh and it affects the phenotype what is     
51:36     
the difference between the two it's not something you can necessarily do in humans but in something like seans is     
51:43     
much easier to do but anyways that's the basic type of experimental comparison you     
51:50     
have so yeah there's a lot of stuff here it's just you know a lot of good papers     
51:55     
uh basically in that region you know we have just atlases where we have a soil     
52:01     
resolution atlas of broka area we have different types of profiling we do a lot     
52:07     
they're doing a lot of stuff with development uh with you know diversity of neurons and kind of get you know kind     
52:14     
of getting that space nailed down to some degree you know     
52:20     
so uh that's that's the brain cell census um I'll send a link out after the     
52:26     
meeting on that uh so yeah thanks Morgan for bringing that to my attention is     
52:33     
there anything you'd like to say about that     
52:43     
or well afraid I'm just about to head off for a school run okay but yeah a lot     
52:50     
of lot of good papers to to take in there obviously okay so then     
52:55     
the last thing I wanted to do is uh I want to go over this paper here and this     
53:01     
is a paper out of a new Journal uh PRX life so this is physics     
53:08     
reviews X and they have like physics reviews X is like the open- source     
53:14     
version of physics reviews like different letters after the uh physics reviews and this is X then they have     
53:21     
this new Journal called PRX life which is focus on biophysics and biology and     
53:29     
you know from a physics perspective so there a lot there are a lot of interesting papers coming out in     
53:35     
that journal I think they've had like two issues so far um this one ises from     
53:41     
the first issue this ISS models of cell processes are far from the edge of     
53:48     
chaos and uh this is a number of authors uh on this uh so the abstract uh     
53:58     
reads complex living systems are thought to exist at the edge of chaos separating     
54:03     
the ordered dynamics of robust function from the disordered dynamics of Rapid     
54:09     
environmental adaptation so what it means is that you and you have a biological system it's     
54:15     
this first of all this complex system and it exists at the what they call the edge of chaos and so the edge of chaos     
54:22     
means that it's not like a determinist system it's you know but it's also not a     
54:28     
chaotic system it sort of exists at the edge of what they call chaos and I'm not going to go into like what physicists     
54:34     
mean by chaos it's it's different than what the Quil term is for it because we     
54:40     
usually think of chaos Sy highly disordered in physics chaos things are     
54:47     
not necessarily highly disordered but they're you know they're very they're highly variable and there's certain     
54:54     
properties to chaotic systems that are you know being at the edge of chaos is     
55:00     
important for leveraging those properties but also having a system that     
55:05     
is you know uh functional under a wide range of conditions things don't break down necessarily but they they become     
55:13     
you know adaptive so so that's why they're separating the ordered dynamics of robust function     
55:20     
meaning that you can have like a pathway that operates under many different conditions so like you know your metabolism     
55:27     
operates under a wide variety of conditions and that's a robust function instead of being a brittle function     
55:34     
where you know maybe your uh metabolism worked like a machine where it might     
55:39     
break if it you know gets out of whack if the parameters are you know pushed     
55:46     
like if you get sick for example you don't want to die uh you can tolerate a     
55:51     
lot of like ill health before you die Maybe and so that's what robust function     
55:56     
means and then that's compared with the disordered dynamics of Rapid environmental adaptation which means     
56:03     
that if you need to adapt to the environment you can but that also introduces a lot of disorder to the     
56:10     
system so this is what they mean by edge of chaos so here a deeper inspection of 72     
56:17     
experimentally supported discrete dynamical models so these are just     
56:22     
dynamical systems models that are discrete uh and this is of cell processes so they     
56:28     
have these uh different models of cell processes reveals previously in observed     
56:35     
order on long time scales so they're looking at long time scales simulating them over long time     
56:41     
scales and there's this order in the system that they're identifying and so this suggests a     
56:48     
greater rigidity of these systems than was previously conjectured so this is what so basically     
56:55     
we go back to this idea of the edge of chaos now the edge of chaos you know kind of we think about chaos we think     
57:01     
about it being disordered we think about being highly adaptive if it's on the edge of chaos and then we look at the     
57:09     
models we do this study and we find that there's this order on long time scale so     
57:15     
that means that when you have these kind of changes you have this regime of sort of being change friendly that it's still     
57:22     
kind of Hues to this long kind scale of order so I mean a good example of that     
57:28     
is your body your metabolism runs a different sort of um you know you can     
57:34     
adapt to a lot of things you don't you can get sick but you don't die from certain perturbations to your     
57:41     
metabolism and but you know your metabolism is still sort of has set points it doesn't break down over time     
57:48     
unless you die maybe when you're aging it breaks down a little bit but there's this underlying order     
57:55     
and so there's a greater rigidity than we kind of thought from the models so this is this an interesting kind of uh     
58:02     
thing to think about that we have these uh physiological systems say or complex     
58:08     
living system like a cell that has a you know a wide range of sort of operating     
58:14     
parameters that the operating parameters can be pushed in many different ways and many different     
58:19     
directions and it and the cells or the system can adapt but also doesn't go out     
58:26     
of state and stays within a certain state so this is really one of the things about biology that is kind of     
58:32     
fascinating is this sort of robustness over time so we find that propagation of internal     
58:40     
perturbations is transient most cases so when you perturb your system it doesn't     
58:47     
necessarily stick with the system you might have a memory of that     
58:52     
perturbation uh but you don't it doesn't really adversely affect the system now it may     
58:58     
be that you know if you get sick you might have it might you know uh maybe     
59:03     
injure you in some way or it could be like you know that if you uh get sick     
59:10     
that you build up a resistance to something but that's not really what they're     
59:15     
talking about here in any case there may be some examples counter examples of that um and even when large perturbation     
59:23     
Cascades per which could be where you experience a very large perturbation to that system     
59:29     
and there's there all sorts of things that result from that so you know if you have like say for example uh a large     
59:37     
scale environmental perturbation on a species you might have you know not an     
59:42     
Extinction but a large die off that those effects are often minimal but     
59:48     
sometimes they can be fairly large you know just depends on what this what's going on in the system     
59:55     
uh but the idea is that there may be some memory for perturbations but it isn't it doesn't predominate the system     
1:00:02     
it can operate in the face of a lot of perturbations and retain its essential character as we would     
1:00:09     
say moreover we find evidence that stochasticity and desynchronization can lead to increased     
1:00:16     
recovery from regulatory perturbation C uh perturbation Cascades so this is     
1:00:22     
where we have stochastic it where we have Randomness and desynchronization so     
1:00:28     
sometimes things will become desynchronized to will allow for recovery so you know we have tightly     
1:00:34     
interrelated biological processes you know they don't exist as like hogs in a     
1:00:39     
in a machine they can be desynchronized and I think a good example of that is like brain synchrony     
1:00:46     
with brain States you know that those can be desynchronized or synchronized in     
1:00:51     
different ways that are adaptive so this is kind of an interesting point as     
1:00:56     
well our analysis relies on new measures that quantify the tendency of perturbations to spread through a     
1:01:03     
discrete dynamical system so this is where they're looking at these new measures to look at like you know if you     
1:01:10     
perturb a system A dynamical system can we look at the spread of things throughout that system and so that     
1:01:16     
suggests you know things like networks one of the authors on this is Reika Elbert who did a lot of these uh 7     
1:01:24     
papers on network science with uh uh     
1:01:30     
with baracy uh and you know so that's and Lis roacha has done a lot of stuff with     
1:01:36     
ecology and other types of complex systems so you know these connections are important and so we can actually     
1:01:45     
develop measures that look how things per uh sort of uh propagate through a     
1:01:50     
network and spread through we can model the network as a discre dynamical system     
1:01:56     
propagate through that Computing these measures is not feasible using current methodology thus     
1:02:02     
we developed a multi-purpose Cuda based simulation tool so this is something it's a computational tool uh which we     
1:02:10     
made available as the open source python Library Cube Walkers so they actually     
1:02:15     
have this python Library you can download and use for this based on novel measures and simulations our results     
1:02:22     
suggests that contrary to current theory cell processes are ordered and far from     
1:02:27     
the edge of chaos so they're they're actually making a different argument here from what most people are making     
1:02:33     
and this this uh edge of chaos argument I think really has been like kind of uh     
1:02:40     
sort of a qualitative judgment about cells and and other types of processes     
1:02:46     
that basically you know they're at the edge of chaos because they look like they're very Dynamic but we don't know     
1:02:52     
they're not obviously not chaotic so you know they're far they're at the edge of chaos and so they're actually saying     
1:02:58     
that that's not true that cell processes are ordered they have a lot of order especially long-term order and so while     
1:03:05     
they're robust they don't exist at the edge of chaos and so they talk about the edge of chaos here this is a coin term     
1:03:12     
by Norm Packard in 1988 so this goes way back into the early days of artificial     
1:03:18     
life research and in complexity research this idea has been around a lot um this     
1:03:25     
refers to the tendency of adaptive systems to evolve towards a dynamical regime that lies between order and     
1:03:32     
Disorder so this is a tendency of a lot of very complex systems that are very     
1:03:38     
adaptive you know you can think of cell processes but you can also think of like uh Urban systems or you know other types     
1:03:46     
of systems that are very complex that have a lot of moving parts and and     
1:03:52     
actually look to the eye which is important that they have a lot of     
1:03:57     
properties of chaos but aren't chaotic so in systems biology this is     
1:04:03     
often referred to as the criticality hypothesis and is closely related to the work of Kaufman and dareda who     
1:04:10     
demonstrated that simple tunable models of Gene regulation exhibit an order to chaos phase transition so this is where     
1:04:17     
you have a model of Gene regulation maybe a gene regulatory Network and you     
1:04:23     
can actually exhibit this you know you can go from order to chaos and there's this phase transition     
1:04:28     
that characterizes this and so near this transition is conjectured living systems     
1:04:34     
optimally balance the rigidity required to function in a noisy environment with the flexibility required to undergo     
1:04:41     
developmental metabolic and evolutionary processes depend on cellular context     
1:04:47     
with that big sentence means is that basically you can balance the need to     
1:04:54     
sort of be very adaptive if you're in a noisy environment and but you can also do that     
1:04:59     
in a way that's flexible but also consistent with your uh mechanisms that you have available to you so it isn't     
1:05:06     
just a free-for-all you don't just adapt in any old way you can adapt to a lot of different conditions but you have these     
1:05:14     
uh mechanisms that you can use and you know you can go in a certain direction or you can return to your set point as     
1:05:21     
needed um and so we don't really we've we've me we've talked about edge of     
1:05:27     
chaos for years but people haven't really understood what that actually means in a very rigorous context so this     
1:05:34     
is really kind of going through actually the aidas study was in random Boolean     
1:05:40     
networks so I guess this is you know this is a type of well you can model     
1:05:45     
grns using random Boolean networks but this is where you know this is the kind of level of uh analysis that people have     
1:05:53     
been using for this where they have a random Boolean Network which is where you have zeros and ones and you have     
1:05:59     
this random Network and you simulate things on that Network so that's the level of analysis in this paper they use     
1:06:08     
uh many many different types of tools that are much more rigorous and complex     
1:06:15     
than what they were using there and so they actually have they have a Boolean Network that they're using but it's um     
1:06:22     
you know comparing different types of models so they have this software Cube Walkers     
1:06:28     
this is a python Library this is a Boolean Network simulator and you know     
1:06:34     
it allows you to uh it supports various user update schemes uh node and edge control     
1:06:41     
interventions and probabilistic update rules and so this is where you can do     
1:06:46     
this uh they have different categories like cancer cell cycle development and     
1:06:52     
differentiation metabolism and then they have different types of models highlighted models like ausus     
1:06:59     
network uh cell cycle for rabid opsis uh you know cortical area     
1:07:07     
development uh signal transduction fiber blast so a lot of different uh cell     
1:07:13     
cycle transcription a lot of different model systems that they have in there in different categories so yeah so I don't     
1:07:23     
know where the link is probably in the paper somewhere um for this this     
1:07:29     
repository where the software is but I'll finish with this where they have a     
1:07:34     
graph of this phase bace you have robust sensitive to robust sensitive and then     
1:07:41     
robust is sensitive so this models so these are short and long-term perturbation responses in the cell     
1:07:47     
Collective measured in a phase and sensitive way so this is where you have a robust response a sensitive or robust     
1:07:55     
response sensitive and then robust to sensitive um in the robust regime lower     
1:08:01     
left quadrant both short-term and long-term responses are below one so     
1:08:06     
that's for this uh derod coefficient synchronization     
1:08:12     
coefficient uh which indicates perturbation Extinction and is characterized by order Dynamics so this     
1:08:18     
is order the sort of the ordered regime it's robust but it's ordered in the     
1:08:23     
sense of regime which is up here in the upper right uh both short-term and long-term responses are above one this     
1:08:30     
indicates perturbation growth which means that it propagates throughout the system the perturbation dominates and     
1:08:37     
you get maybe chaotic Dynamics and then the other two quadrants indicate cases of disagreement     
1:08:44     
between the short-term and long-term responses so this is where they're competing and there's this phase     
1:08:49     
transition of between the two that you could characterize in contrast with the     
1:08:54     
traditional approach depicted in the left panel of figure four which is we're not going to see this figure illustrates     
1:09:01     
perturbation response when source source nodes and phase shifts are accounted for basically they're trying to model sort     
1:09:09     
of the properties of this network where maybe the no to different states and then uh most models show a     
1:09:16     
substantially more robust perturbation response when these factors are taken into consideration the symbols indicate     
1:09:23     
the model category ories so you have these different symbols in here so they have this Ensemble of models and they're     
1:09:28     
modeling this these different transitions sensitive robust robust is     
1:09:33     
sensitive or where the nodes have different states and they sort of fight it out for you know what which one's     
1:09:40     
going to dominate robust is where everything is sort of ordered and then sensitive is where everything is chaotic     
1:09:47     
so now I'd like to go over figure 10 in this paper and these are five different ways or five different systems in which     
1:09:53     
they apply the random Boolean networks but more importantly they get the state transition graphs which you can see here     
1:10:01     
to show sort of how there's an update dependence so in other words the previous state affects the current state     
1:10:08     
and so forth and so without getting into the measures that they use in the paper     
1:10:13     
we can see that there are five different examples different I guess biological     
1:10:18     
systems uh and then the way the different ways in which these Network apologies are configured and these are     
1:10:26     
the state transition graphs so the different ways in which they're updated and so it makes sense to have     
1:10:32     
different configurations for different types of systems because different systems operate differently and have     
1:10:38     
different Dynamics so the first one are delay sensitivities and oscillations so this is again where you     
1:10:46     
have a synchronous and an asynchronous day transition graph you have where you know this zero     
1:10:53     
Z doesn't update anything but 01 leads to one zero leads to one one and then     
1:11:00     
back to 01 so these three states here are transitive and z z is left out in     
1:11:06     
the asynchronous case however uh z0 is the end state for 01 and one zero one     
1:11:14     
zero leads to one one and there's this feedback between 01 and     
1:11:20     
one and so then this leads this transition graph down here and this is a three-state system or     
1:11:27     
three bit system I guess where you have different state transition rules the second one is an attractor     
1:11:34     
Basin update or the robustness of metabolic interactions in the dut     
1:11:39     
microbion so this is where we actually take a specific type of system not just     
1:11:45     
oscillations and we map them to this random buan Network so we have three     
1:11:52     
parts of this for the different components of the interactions we have an order that we work from we have the     
1:11:58     
shared part of the state transition graph we have the rest of the synchronous State transition graph and     
1:12:04     
then the rest of the asynchronous state transition graph and then for the third example     
1:12:10     
update dependence and Colitis Associated colon cancer we have this state transition     
1:12:16     
Network here according to these rules these are the different components and then the different     
1:12:21     
transitions between them and then we have our synchronous State transition graph with the state order so     
1:12:28     
we use that order to build that graph and then an asynchronous a transition graph with the same order but then we     
1:12:35     
also take asynchron into account uh then we have update dependent     
1:12:41     
attractor basins and cortical area development so this is where we have uh     
1:12:47     
different genes and we have a state order here and then we have uh States     
1:12:53     
colored by asynchronous Basin of Attraction so they go from yellow to green or yellow to green and they show     
1:13:01     
from synchronous to asynchronous so there's this gradient and then these are the different states and how they uh     
1:13:09     
allow for these transitions from state to state and then finally we have a     
1:13:14     
tractor base in size and a simplified apototic model so we have these factors     
1:13:20     
here c 3 Cass 6 I AP and and you know we have the different rules transition     
1:13:26     
rules there and then we have our synchronous State transition graph with the state order based on this graph at     
1:13:33     
the top like we did for C and then we have the asynchronous state transition graph with that same state order and so     
1:13:40     
that gives us some order for rules for these transitions but we have both     
1:13:46     
synchronous and asynchronous cases if we look at uh the legend here     
1:13:53     
we can you can see that panel a illustrates Del way dependency uh in the examples of different equations that they introduce     
1:14:00     
which are inspired by cell cycle transcription by couple uh cdk Network oscillators so in biology we have this     
1:14:08     
oscillator the cell cycle that they're using as inspiration for this model uh panel B demonstrates how much     
1:14:15     
the state transition graph of the metabolic interactions in the gut microbiome model which they cite as     
1:14:21     
citation 40 is robust changes an update scheme we can use other systems like     
1:14:26     
cortical area development models and a reduced version of the apotosis network model which is cited in 43 in each of     
1:14:34     
these interaction networks each node symbol contains the update function of the node blue edges ending in filed     
1:14:40     
circles indicate positive regulation so that's up here and then the red edges     
1:14:46     
ending in Open Circles denote negative regulation these blue edges of circles are positive regulation these red edges     
1:14:53     
with Open Circles represent negative regulation and the same holds true for e as well in asynchronous updates states     
1:15:00     
can reach more than one attractor s such states are shaded using a gradient and so that's why we have these gradients in     
1:15:06     
these two examples CN the lower Pan part of panel a states can differ only in the     
1:15:12     
value of the Del node Y and are grouped together in shaded boxes so if the Shaded boxes are here as you can see     
1:15:19     
they form sort of sub regions of this state uh graph I think that's an interesting paper it kind of gets into     
1:15:26     
like a lot of these things when we say the cell is very complex okay but how do we look at that how do we understand it     
1:15:32     
and characterize     
1:15:39     
it okay so any comments or questions about that     
1:15:46     
paper I'd like to know more about the Boolean operations they're working with     
1:15:56     
yeah I don't know if reading the paper would help yeah well I think the idea of like     
1:16:03     
a random Boolean network is that each node in the network has a a state at zero to one it can be flipped so you     
1:16:10     
could have like a a network where you flip it from one state to another order to random or some other set of     
1:16:18     
operations and then the operations are just what under what conditions that flip happens     
1:16:23     
could be probabilistic it could be something where certain conditions are met and so that's basically the idea of     
1:16:31     
that kind of network a random Network just refers to how it's connected so the     
1:16:36     
nodes are connected in a certain way random networks are usually like you know connected randomly you could have     
1:16:42     
scale-free networks which are connected in different you know to different degrees uh and and other types of     
1:16:49     
networks as well so yeah then the way it's connected of course depends on how things propagate     
1:16:56     
through the network so if you have a node that's like you know disordered but it's not very highly connected to the     
1:17:02     
network its effect on the network as a whole is going to be decreased because it can't really get its message out to     
1:17:08     
the other nodes and uh you know that and and the converse holds true as well if     
1:17:14     
there's a highly connected node in the network and in random networks you don't really have this but in something like a     
1:17:20     
scale free network you do or a small world Network especially if it's very highly connected that node if it's     
1:17:27     
disordered can really broadcast throughout the system and really kind of have an outsized effect and so the the     
1:17:34     
way that you organize the network is important the conditions under which the nodes can be switched from ordered to     
1:17:41     
disordered is also     
1:17:46     
important don't know if it would work for a 10 segr Network well I think like with     
1:17:53     
tensegrity your connect your connections aren't in this kind of regime it's more like the connections are sort of     
1:18:00     
physical so it's like you know you have your connections depend on like the structure of the tensegrity so like if     
1:18:08     
you have things that are like if you have maybe things that are holding intention you might have like     
1:18:15     
connections that are sort of symmetrical in nature so you wouldn't have the     
1:18:21     
conventional random scale free structure you'd have something else and that would actually     
1:18:27     
be interesting because it's a very different type of network very different type of structure and things propagate     
1:18:32     
through those networks differently actually and I don't know if they're     
1:18:39     
um if they're um have uh let's see     
1:18:45     
yeah um High degree of elasticity like or if they're stiffer you get more     
1:18:53     
propagation through the network than if you've got something that's soft elastic     
1:18:59     
right then it tends to stay in the general area but if it's     
1:19:05     
um um tension element which is elastic and it's say like a string that that is     
1:19:13     
not elastic you get um the forces move throughout the whole     
1:19:22     
the whole that way yeah yes I can demonstrate     
1:19:30     
that a model I have here oh so the edges     
1:19:35     
would be uh you know in that case the edges would have different properties as well where you would have some that are     
1:19:41     
like you know have a certain impedance and you'd have to Define that so yeah it's interesting that you can you know a     
1:19:48     
lot of the complex networks research that's been done they they kind of assume the edges are uniform you know     
1:19:55     
maybe they have a weight but that's usually the connection weight not they don't think about the physics of the connection usually and so if you have a     
1:20:02     
soft material that edge actually maybe is weighted by physics and that like     
1:20:08     
maybe like a correlation or something like that which is usually the case um I     
1:20:13     
guess you could use a correlation but it wouldn't mean the same thing quite point mean the same thing well anyway the     
1:20:19     
physics of tties gets complicated yeah     
1:20:25     
yeah especially if you're um perturbing them with a frequency you can get them     
1:20:32     
to collapse right yeah     
1:20:38     
yeah anyway sometimes you want that and sometimes you don't     
1:20:44     
yeah and if you're using consle it thinks you're building a bridge so if it collapses this is a bad thing and it     
1:20:51     
won't produce an output it just says error and really no that's not an error     
1:20:58     
it's fine if it's kind of collaps that was fine that was what I wanted yeah     
1:21:05     
anyway well if a cell collapses that's a bad thing too right it's held up by its     
1:21:12     
neighbors oh okay that's true yeah in that     
1:21:17     
way yeah it is and when it collapses they turn into     
1:21:23     
mezen cell that goes and crawls off     
1:21:28     
somewhere and they can move as a cell sheet as well there's the three different     
1:21:34     
modes yeah but they're literally held up by their     
1:21:40     
neighbors they're a a network that way yeah so what happens try to get your     
1:21:47     
head around it just like     
1:21:53     
so one aside on that what happens if you have like apotosis or or something like that where the cell dies in a sheet and     
1:22:00     
did they just kind of fill in I mean from a structural perspective is they squeeze it out there's images of it     
1:22:07     
being squeeze and it goes popping out the top and and then there's sort of a hole and then it it fills that     
1:22:16     
in and it produces a a different patterning in the cell sheet and then     
1:22:24     
that resolves itself as well like this said things     
1:22:31     
like T T1 T2 T3 transitions gets into that area of     
1:22:38     
things but yeah literally it squeezes this the TIC cell     
1:22:45     
out out the top and it goes springing out apparently it really does act like a     
1:22:54     
spring yeah it exells the the dead cells     
1:23:00     
wow the network does and so this this the network is able to maintain its     
1:23:05     
stability throughout all this right there's no yeah it does there's you can     
1:23:11     
there's a rosette configuration that's formed yeah when that     
1:23:16     
happens which is interesting it's h to causer ration in the cell sheet     
1:23:23     
and so if you stuck like a little probe like a pipe head in there you couldn't like disrupt that process it would just     
1:23:30     
kind of be stable to that perturbation um I don't know um     
1:23:37     
people um bladed uh holes in cell sheets and looked at the forces and the cell     
1:23:44     
sheets just tend to fill in fill in the     
1:23:49     
hole wound healing you know yeah yeah I don't know I'm trying to     
1:23:56     
understand it more yeah sort of and I just discovered there's a oh yeah there's a paper that's by fredberg     
1:24:05     
and um starts with an a uh do I have it here um I'll send it to you okay yeah     
1:24:14     
it' be good um because it's a history of their lab and how they've been working     
1:24:20     
with epithelial cells and still haven't figured it all out but it's a a very     
1:24:27     
nice summary of the study of epithelial cells so um anyway yeah it's frad bir     
1:24:35     
okay yeah and that in one time came to the     
1:24:40     
university yeah that's great okay need to get you that     
1:24:48     
yeah so do anyone else want to say anything before we go for today     
1:24:57     
I also have some idea for some some words if you actually if anyone would be     
1:25:03     
interested uh following my conversation at the beginning of the session uh I've     
1:25:10     
been trying to have some comparison between     
1:25:18     
and so I decided to write the first chapter of the bsh I was talking     
1:25:25     
about production that's is going to discuss how     
1:25:30     
historically uh actually development of the brain of the seon is uh actually     
1:25:37     
what what has been studied so far for from from a developmental point of view     
1:25:42     
to to the air system of cagans from the stage maybe the first stage of its uh     
1:25:49     
development to actually     
1:25:57     
2st second day of it live so uh I would be happy if anyone is interested in     
1:26:04     
collaboration with this with this trib paper maybe I'm more I'm going to more     
1:26:11     
focus on how uh actually different Works have been done so far     
1:26:17     
and different uh from from a simple from     
1:26:23     
the simplest uh model that has been so far uh discovered from how to c is     
1:26:30     
working I mean the mathematical model mainly two maybe the the most complex     
1:26:37     
one so far so if you know of any some differences that we could start with uh     
1:26:43     
I I would be happy to uh so with some references and then add them to to the     
1:26:48     
main uh review paper or the main chapter and I'm going to discuss it every week     
1:26:56     
of my progress and so would be happy if anyone is interested in collaboration     
1:27:02     
and chapter uh maybe a review paper as well     
1:27:08     
that sounds greated uh yeah I'm sure that we have people interested in that     
1:27:15     
so uh yeah and also do the things that we were doing on that I mean it's seans     
1:27:21     
is an interesting because we know so much about the nervous system so that sounds like a good place to start you     
1:27:28     
okay the the references in the chat okay yeah yeah I saw that that's biophysics     
1:27:34     
reviews yeah okay yeah thank you for that life     
1:27:40     
off the Beaten Track and biomechanics yeah great     
1:27:47     
stuff okay well thank you everyone for attending um see you next     
1:27:54     
week thank you thanks everyone bye
