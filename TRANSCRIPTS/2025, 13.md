0:09     
hello How are you hi     
0:14     
Good Good How are you all     
0:21     
right So uh I guess if you wanted to give any updates     
0:26     
uh now's the time Uh sir I just wanted to let you know     
0:33     
that uh I've been uh reading and you know trying to     
0:38     
understand whether uh what can be extended from like uh previous project because I have seen that uh in the last     
0:45     
meeting I've discussed that linear hyperraphs and linear hyperraphs and uh     
0:51     
you know the spatial hyperraphs So my theme was to make a unified model So     
0:56     
which can integrate both and uh you know we can design the dynamic uh you know uh     
1:02     
the I mean like embryoenesis can be made in a you know in a dynamic fashion by     
1:08     
both integrating this both the features So what I was thinking is uh I mean like I little share my screen once     
1:18     
uh uh I mean so it's it might be a little     
1:25     
vague but I am trying to think that uh you know I've been reading this work for quite a long time So this uh was a     
1:32     
recent work and uh I I read like certain     
1:37     
parts of it and I wanted to implement because uh this works fundamentally uh     
1:43     
focuses on uh you know various hyperraph neural networks So how is the message     
1:50     
passing done how do we design the features how do we design you know uh I mean like the structural information how     
1:56     
can we feed into the network how do we define a hyperraph what kind of uh you     
2:02     
know uh different uh variations that we can see in this and how can we do the message passing how can we learn the     
2:09     
temporal relationships uh for uh growing hypographs so I     
2:15     
thought uh this could be a great work that to start with so what I'm thinking     
2:20     
is right now uh so first I want to design a unified hyperraph uh uh I mean     
2:27     
like uh the network which can both understand the lineage and uh the I mean     
2:32     
like the 3D spatial information with that I will be able to understand So how     
2:40     
does a hyperraph structure help us and later on I wanted to understand and     
2:45     
apply different mechanisms such as uh you know the message passing mechanisms and understand like you know how     
2:51     
attention and where exactly the attention is required and how do the message passing evolve Do we required     
2:58     
like uh you know the I mean like what is the significant component while you know     
3:04     
uh the during the I mean like understanding the first connetos and then during the evolution what are the     
3:11     
key significant factors it's actually essential and where it's actually the model is trying to this I wanted to     
3:19     
understand using uh these hypograph models so these are not yet fully     
3:25     
benchmarked so I wanted to read this work and I wanted to present all the     
3:30     
detailed information regarding the various hypographs and I want to implement uh for the C elegance uh     
3:38     
evolutional data So I think uh and uh doing that if I try I I I'm pretty not     
3:46     
sure I'll be able to visualize well but what I can do is uh if suppose I wanted to attend at a certain uh I mean like     
3:53     
these are certain features and these are certain nodes that I'm trying to attend I mean like providing the attention then     
3:58     
I I will try to visualize using some of basic tools but my my idea is to like     
4:05     
you know incorporate graph hypograph neural networks into like to see how the development progresses I wanted to see     
4:12     
the progression using these different set of methods and I thought this could be apt into the space because what we     
4:18     
thought was like to design of more like a diverse hyperraph architectures where     
4:23     
we can implement them step by step and first we'll come up with a unified model and on top of that we'll try to     
4:29     
understand various attention mechanisms that can be possible and another and I also thought of uh you know why this     
4:35     
could exactly align into the spaces because what we were thinking is uh it's     
4:40     
not we that cells you know they divide and they integrate and during this process I think that you know the     
4:47     
hyperraph this multisellular interactions that we see this and the group level transitions that may happen     
4:54     
during the development that that can be definitely seen by you know understanding various mechanisms of this     
5:00     
sort so so I mean I am I I am like I try     
5:06     
to get a clear intuition of this after uh reading and I thought this could be a     
5:12     
correct fit into the space So I'll share the paper sir and probably I'll give a     
5:18     
presentation uh and while giving the presentation I will maintain the     
5:24     
perspective that how this could be useful for our our you know the clans     
5:29     
how this can be useful for uh and each and every component that I'm trying to you know explain I will probably explain     
5:36     
in the perspective of how it can be useful for like no only to see elegance     
5:42     
the developmental process of embryogenesis So yeah Yeah it sounds good You you     
5:49     
weren't going to present it today were you or no sir I I'm preparing uh the     
5:54     
presentation and probably next by the next week I'll be able to finish the entire presentation Okay that sounds     
6:00     
good Thank you That looks interesting So could you bring back that could you     
6:06     
reshare your screen i wanted to see that taxonomy I guess Yes     
6:17     
Yes All right Yeah it looks interesting So you have uh you're modeling higher order     
6:23     
interactions Yes And you're encoding input features     
6:29     
Yes Input structure message passing And the way we are training the network     
6:36     
is objective So there are like two different mechanisms which I'm really interested in one is uh a supervised     
6:43     
approach where we give uh you know saying that you know this is the label or this is the ground truth and we are     
6:49     
trying to train in that perspective or we can use a self-s supervised perspective so uh so I mean like I've     
6:56     
read the paper but I wanted to delve into deep with uh a nice perspective of uh you know C elegance and I think     
7:03     
implementing in this fashion could be an uh extension to the work that was already done and I think this could be a     
7:10     
great uh you know start off is what I felt     
7:16     
So I mean like I mean like I want your thought on     
7:22     
this Yeah Well yeah I think we     
7:27     
uh you know we go through the taxonomy and see which things are kind of fit the     
7:32     
data the best Okay I don't know what like how you had this in mind Um I would     
7:40     
maybe propose the best things that you can think of for from your perspective     
7:46     
and then we can argue about it or um you know evaluate it I think it'll be I     
7:51     
think you should be able to uh break things down though So we can     
7:58     
make a I I'm curious Is this something that you     
8:03     
uh are kind of aiming for in your proposal i know you're writing a Google Summer of Code proposal     
8:09     
Yes sir I I have started a small description of it but I'm curating the references and I'm thinking that what uh     
8:17     
actually aligns and what what actually makes a uh I mean like you know a good improvement So I also wanted to I mean     
8:26     
like see it in not just uh I mean like uh you know the code perspective but I     
8:31     
wanted to see that you know what actually this can get me So I also want the novelty part to be done So that will     
8:39     
give me more uh motivated keep me more motivated and uh work through the lines     
8:44     
So if it's it uh if it's going to be a good publishable results then that will     
8:50     
be a very much uh helpful for me to or in even the community Okay Yeah I think     
8:58     
um well I mean yeah we'd have to talk about that further Yes Yeah So I mean     
9:04     
you know like uh the I guess supervised versus unsupervised     
9:09     
perspective you know you're talking about the kinds of data that you can bring into the algorithm Yeah So C     
9:16     
elegance has labels and a lot of I think you could have a lot of supervision potential Yes sir You could have like     
9:23     
you know labels of cells tissues or labels in time We have     
9:29     
all sorts of data like that Uh there other     
9:34     
uh systems where you don't have that and that's you know that's why we work in C     
9:39     
elegance a lot Um but there are other ways that you can do this that aren't     
9:45     
labeled necessarily or the labels change and it's harder to get like good label     
9:51     
data So um you know it's it really depends if you want something that's     
9:57     
specific to C elegance you know supervised is good but sort of     
10:02     
biologically generalizable I guess you could say unsupervised would be good yes     
10:09     
thing things you have to think about like that and yes uh yeah yeah I think this is all good okay we'll go over that     
10:17     
next week I guess yes and uh I'll start writing you A rough draft probably so     
10:24     
that we can iterate on top of that Rough draft a rough draft of the     
10:30     
proposal of uh how do we take things I mean like what could be a good uh     
10:36     
weightage to the project and all Yeah Okay     
10:42     
Okay All right So we have anyone else uh wanted to give an update     
10:50     
thank you with that was good Thank you     
10:58     
Giadratha or so ham Yeah Hi I want to ask one thing So the mail     
11:07     
you have sent uh that has all the data sets that are available and I checked     
11:13     
all those data sets and I tried to understand and those are already     
11:19     
available in uh GitHub GitHub page right most of them     
11:24     
the data sets yeah so I okay so I analyzed those data sets and     
11:34     
uh the the last in the last meeting uh so     
11:39     
we discussed about the temporal graph methods and all and also we have     
11:44     
discussed about uh visualization thing in 3D     
11:50     
So yeah so uh the thing is uh I understood about uh from the data which     
11:57     
are already available from that uh this temporal graph part that can be done uh     
12:05     
like as I can understand and for for the visualization part that can be a side     
12:12     
project or like small thing that we can include uh but for a larger project or     
12:19     
for a for the for this GA I understood key like this can be better uh to pursue     
12:28     
the temporal graph So what do you think uh I I want your opinion on that Should     
12:34     
we include both of them like the visualization uh the based on our     
12:40     
discussion last last day is it the visualization as well as the temporal graph or only temporal graph part for     
12:48     
this G subator     
12:54     
[Laughter]     
13:01     
so I think that uh could have uh both I think both uh     
13:07     
but I think the temporal graph stuff would have to be kind of the priority     
13:12     
then the visualization could come kind of at the end like so you know getting down the basics of what that's going to     
13:20     
look like implementing it and then visualizing things that's our division visualize something you don't have the     
13:27     
methods nailed down for We have you know I I don't know how much work the visualization would take It'd     
13:34     
be a couple of couple of weeks uh to get something I     
13:39     
mean you could work on it as you're going along but I would prioritize the temporal     
13:44     
graph and then you know maybe maybe try some visualizations at the end try to     
13:51     
implement some usually the way we do proposals is we say you know what do we want to focus on and then to sort of     
13:58     
follow up on uh later um and then you know if we have time we can implement     
14:05     
the visualizations fully but just having like kind of a you know sort of this is what it would     
14:14     
look like you know it's just kind of not you're not spending all your time in the     
14:20     
visualization does that make sense yeah I yeah thank you     
14:30     
um yeah thank you hi hi Bradley uh sorry to interrupt I     
14:36     
don't really have an update I just wanted to say I have written my proposal     
14:41     
draft based on the presentation I gave last week So I will uh send that to you via Slack So if you have time please     
14:48     
give your feedbacks before submitting the final     
14:55     
Okay All right Um Susan how are you     
15:04     
hello All they've got is uh interesting uh vacation photos So     
15:14     
that's good Anyways I'm just just recovering from a     
15:21     
vacation so I have to write a paper so I'm need to get on with it     
15:29     
Yeah Right Okay     
15:35     
Oh cool How are you uh hi Bradley Hi everyone Yeah I'm I'm     
15:44     
good Uh this week like I was talking to uh     
15:49     
like Le Suham and has like given like a rough     
15:54     
drama like I I still have to review it like he gave me like I think yesterday so I'll get back to him So that is what     
16:00     
I'm up to these days like on the weekends Yeah     
16:07     
sounds good     
16:16     
Yeah Anything else no no nothing else right now All right     
16:22     
Thanks Thanks Yeah Hello Morgan Hello Dick All right So     
16:31     
um let's start off with some things Uh so I have another article on this sort     
16:38     
of theme that we've been talking about a little bit called limits on a cell So I     
16:43     
we did this um we covered this Azimov press article     
16:49     
on breaking the speed limit on of cell division that I don't remember when that was I think it was in January and I went     
16:56     
through this uh paper or this article talking about sort of the     
17:02     
limits to cell division So the idea was that you know if we want to have a     
17:09     
programmable system you know we we can think about a computer program and how     
17:15     
fast we can run computer programs and then we might want to take that sort of     
17:21     
framework and apply it to biological systems So like things like synthetic     
17:27     
biology where you want program cells and have them reproduce produce like you know a     
17:33     
population of things you can use for different purposes like like you might do with programs as well Uh how do we do     
17:40     
that and what are the limits and so in this paper they talk about the biohysical limits of that kind of an     
17:47     
approach you know you can have say like a a population of bacterial cells You     
17:54     
can um you know boot them up with different genes and then you can use them for different things But to get     
18:01     
like say a certain number of uh cells or in this case I guess they're making the     
18:07     
analogy to programs you know you have some biohysical limits and some of those     
18:12     
limits are DNA replication and then more generally the     
18:18     
speed of cell division So the speed of cell division involves replication of DNA replication     
18:24     
of the genome and then the process of the cell dividing and everything kind of     
18:31     
forming in the new cells So that's they talk about this article we went through this where they talk about the     
18:38     
biohysical limits They focused on the synthesis of ribosomes because those are the things     
18:44     
that you need sort of the key components you need to make proteins So you have to duplicate your     
18:52     
genome You have to create ribosomes You have to synthesize those     
18:58     
Then you have to have ribosomes enough ribosomes in each cell to make proteins And then you need to have the     
19:07     
membrane sort of enclosed in both cells So all that takes time And there's     
19:14     
a fundamental speed limit for DNA replication and for uh ribosome     
19:21     
synthesis And so that's the limit that they have And so if you're thinking in     
19:26     
terms of how to make this process as fast as possible then you're limited by     
19:31     
this biohysical barrier So you can't incre     
19:37     
uh the phases of cell division for example So we have you know uh G1 phase     
19:43     
and G2 phase and we have this these uh so we have these inter intermediate     
19:50     
steps between rounds of replication and division stalling division by roughly 15     
19:56     
more hours So you have to go through G1 and G2 phase to get to cell division and     
20:02     
that's 15 hours where you can't shorten that time period Um and so in sometimes     
20:10     
You have cell types like halos cells uh which actually are cancerous cells that     
20:16     
can double much more quickly than a typical cell But even there you're limited to a speed limit You can't do     
20:24     
this instantaneously Um and then uh we have     
20:29     
bacteria that are very slow So depending on the bacterial cell you choose it you     
20:35     
know can be even slower than that But there is this fundamental speed limit for uh cell division and it has to do     
20:43     
with cell cycle replicating the genome and synthesizing     
20:49     
ribosomes Now that was about the speed of cell division So that's you know how fast can you make cell division and it     
20:56     
varies in different species and varies in different types of cells bacterial cells versus ukarotic cells Bacterial     
21:03     
cells are faster because they have to produce fewer subunits for their ribosomes and their genomes are     
21:09     
generally much smaller and so ukareotic cells are are even slower or even have a     
21:17     
higher or a lower fundamental speed limit Um now this article is another article from Azimo     
21:24     
Press and uh now we'll talk about cell size So     
21:32     
this is what limits a cell's size Um and this is where we talk about two physical     
21:39     
constraints help explain why cells are so tiny The first is the surface area to     
21:45     
volume ratio and the second is the fusion So I think this is something that maybe we're     
21:52     
more comfortable with in this group thinking We thought about this more than the other example Um but it's you know     
22:01     
They're both pretty important So before we thought about okay how long does it take for a cell to divide what's the the     
22:09     
sort of the fundamental doubling time what's the fastest doubling time you can have in a cell and you know we could do     
22:15     
those calculations Um and of course you can't speed that up because you need to have     
22:22     
those components go through those steps that that we talked about In terms of a     
22:28     
cell size we have these physical constraints that kind of act in the same     
22:33     
way that our constraints on time So surface area to volume ratio is where     
22:39     
you have a surface area which is the membrane and then the volume which is inside the cell So as cells grow in size     
22:48     
their surface area grows And so you know we you know we know that like cells in general are pretty small     
22:56     
but sometimes cells can be very big and you know this is something we've talked about with respect to the you know how     
23:03     
big can you make a cell and of course if you think about why don't you just have one big cell doing all sorts of things     
23:10     
in the cell um I think the answer to that is actually pretty easy is that you     
23:15     
know we want to have differentiation in different uh parts of the the embryo So it needs to be     
23:23     
multisellular Um but at the same time we could have a single cell uh organism     
23:29     
that emerges We could have very large single cell organisms instead of multisellular organisms And so you know     
23:35     
why not so one constraint is that surface area to volume ratio has to be     
23:42     
small or reasonable And then diffusion which means that if you have something     
23:47     
that's generated like a mole you know a bunch a bunch of molecules that you want     
23:54     
to reach every part of the cell evenly then it can't you know if it diffuses by     
24:02     
something like brownie emotion then it can't uh go very far over a certain     
24:07     
amount of time So there's a speed limit as to how things can fuse So if you have     
24:12     
a really big cell it takes a while for things to fuse and get out there So uh     
24:18     
we'll talk actually about um I have a paper that just came out this week on archa bacteria and how     
24:26     
there's actually under some conditions you have multisellularity So we'll talk about     
24:32     
that Um but also this you know you might also think about like why don't we have     
24:39     
really big cells and of course in in Drosophila we have development this     
24:45     
cential state where you have this big cell with a bunch of nuclei and then at     
24:50     
some point you have the cellularization phase where things break down and things     
24:56     
become smaller cells and each of those uh nuclei become you know     
25:03     
hosted or a cell host each gem um nucleus So um and then we talked about     
25:10     
saticium last or two weeks ago where you know those are where you have     
25:18     
multiple nuclei in a single cell body But again we talked about what that look     
25:24     
like It doesn't necessarily it isn't necessarily this big sphere It's kind of this thing where the cell bodies are     
25:31     
connected and you know we don't know exactly you know there are all different geometries that you can have so we don't     
25:38     
know if that huge cell would be feasible Um yeah and then we can have     
25:45     
things like uh proto cells which people use in     
25:50     
uh early life research where they just have like this big vesicle that they put     
25:56     
things in uh RNA and proteins and they just use that as a replic a bag of     
26:02     
replication and you know I I don't know too much about if they've experimented     
26:08     
with the size of those signals but they're generally not too big but anyways so this is what lots of cells so     
26:16     
this is uh this article starts with a human body     
26:22     
is built for 30 trillion cells excluding microbes that each arise from a lone     
26:27     
fertilized egg These cells come in a multiplicity of shapes and sizes with     
26:32     
internal volumes spanning five orders of magnitude So this is where you have uh     
26:39     
cells that depending on the cell if it's a microbial cell if it's a mamalian cell     
26:45     
if it's a amphibian cell they're all different     
26:51     
sizes and that spans five orders of magnitude So the smallest human cell a sperm fills     
26:57     
a volume of just 30 microns cubed Whereas an oite builds a volume of 4     
27:04     
million microns cubed making it the largest cell in the human body So an oite is actually very large compared to     
27:11     
sperm and you know different somatic cells     
27:16     
have different sizes There's a wide range there So then what accounts for this huge range even within an organism     
27:23     
and of course you know we know again that like this varies across species but also within species within the same     
27:29     
organ Sometimes a simplistic answer would be that evolution is simply made     
27:34     
each cell whatever size best suits its function which would make sense if you're thinking about something like     
27:40     
sperm but it's a specialized cell It's small because the body produces many of     
27:46     
them and tinier because it costs less energy to make and maintain Uh sperm are     
27:52     
also ultra minimal stripped out a little more than DNA and the few mitochondria necessary for providing energy just been     
28:00     
there like tails So they don't do a lot     
28:05     
functionally they're very uh specialized and so you don't need a lot of stuff     
28:11     
on by contrast an oai needs massive reserves of mitochondria and nutrients     
28:17     
to support early embryionic growth In short every cell is as large or as small     
28:22     
as it needs to be within reason And then you know this is where basically you     
28:27     
have these physical constraints One major limitation on a cell's size surface area to volume ratio     
28:36     
So assuming a cell is roughly spherical in shape its internal volume grows     
28:41     
proportionally to the cube of the sphere's radius So this is why we're     
28:47     
using these micron cube measurements because we have this cubic measurement     
28:52     
that we understand So the internal volume within the cell the sphere it     
28:59     
grows to the cube of the sphere's radius and so we're looking at the radius and kind of you know everything kind of we     
29:06     
assume a symmetrical cell So it's moving outward as um I guess we need space in     
29:13     
in the cell um and its surface area grows proportionally to the square of     
29:18     
that radius So we're thinking about the volume and then we're thinking about the surface area which is the membrane So     
29:26     
the membrane of course is important because things happen at the membrane You know proteins dock at the     
29:32     
membrane and signaling dock at the membrane All sorts of things happen there that are this interface between     
29:39     
this inside of the cell the outside of the cell So having that surface may or     
29:44     
may not be very important uh for different functions So um in other words a cell's     
29:51     
volume grows much more swiftly than surface area So you know just by     
29:57     
sheer geometry this ratio has serious consequences for cellular survival The     
30:04     
cell's membrane funnels nutrients into the cell secretes waste It's also where     
30:09     
the energy in a proarotic cell like ecoli get made Uh so this is where you     
30:15     
know in ecoli you have things happening at the membrane like energy production     
30:21     
You also have waste uh removal and nutrient inputs and then of course     
30:28     
signaling and other things If the interior grows too large relative to the     
30:33     
membrane the cell's metabolic processes slowly grow So this is where you know if     
30:38     
we have this really big cell huge cell uh and then the membrane is I guess     
30:46     
minimized then that slows down metabolic processes because there's no space for them to     
30:55     
um and then this shows a graph A cell's volume scales faster than surface area     
31:00     
So the internal volume of a spherical cell is proportional to proportional to the cube of its radius or as its surface     
31:08     
area is proportional to the square of its radius And this is sort of the graph So for very very big volumes you would     
31:16     
have reduced surface area relative to that That's what he's getting at with the ratio And so you know the larger the     
31:24     
the volume the smaller relatively smaller the surface area And so to     
31:29     
support all that volume to support the metabolism for all that space you don't     
31:35     
have the surface area for that And so metabolism falls until you get to a     
31:41     
point where it's not viable So that's why probably we don't have really big     
31:46     
cells Although in some cases they're specialized for certain functions We might have much larger cells but there     
31:53     
is this limit what we can have Okay So a second constraint is     
31:59     
diffusion or the tendency for molecules to migrate from areas of high concentration to areas of low     
32:06     
concentration If you know about basic diffusion from physics you know that     
32:11     
there's like a source and like molecules will diffuse from that source and     
32:16     
they'll diffuse according to some uh function and that function will describe     
32:23     
sort of the path that these molecules take They can take like a Brownian uh or     
32:29     
random walk you do brownie and motion away from the source But that also means that the closer you are to the source     
32:36     
the higher the concentration of the molecule So you end up with this decay over space uh which you know kind of     
32:44     
decays linearly from the source usually and then you also have this decay over     
32:49     
time which is where you know over time you get more molecules they diffuse     
32:55     
outward you your area of diffusion grows but then you have this decay process     
33:01     
that can also happen in hedges where these molecules like maybe they they     
33:07     
have have a halflife of whatever amount of time So once you reach the halflife     
33:13     
they decay and they no longer viable So this source keeps pumping out these     
33:18     
molecules They diffuse outward and of course they're limited by halflife but     
33:25     
they're also limited by sort of the density that we have And so that's um     
33:31     
that's what diffusion basically is and that's the constraint We you know have     
33:36     
this migration of molecules but we also have this process of diffusion     
33:42     
So in terms of migration migration dictates how quickly enzymes find substrates how effectively     
33:49     
signaling molecules reach receptors and how often ribosomes collect with messenger RNA So when we think about     
33:56     
diffusion we have to think about maybe where something is produced at a certain point at an origin and then diffuses     
34:04     
throughout this this volume this internal volume And then of course uh     
34:10     
this migration is doesn't just happen because just because it happens because     
34:16     
there are things out there that might bind to this uh molecule So I don't I     
34:21     
don't mean to say that there's like a purpose to this but over time you know     
34:27     
you would have this sort of situation where there's something that's diffused and if it's going to be functional it's     
34:34     
going to bind with things in the cell volume And if the cell too big you might have sources of diffusion in different     
34:40     
places It's pumping out all these molecules and it's not binding to its receptors and it's not making this sort     
34:48     
of intentional um you know I guess we could call it a a     
34:53     
deterministic walk where it guided towards uh its binding target and finds     
34:59     
the the quickest path there's this r a random walk where things diffuse they     
35:05     
just diffuse outward and then eventually they reach their target So what that means is that you have to have     
35:11     
relatively constrained volume for that system to work for So things to be both in the state of of diffusion via random     
35:19     
walk and being able to bind to their targets reach receptors and collide with     
35:24     
messenger RNA Now granted inside of the cell is very packed so it doesn't take a     
35:29     
lot of intentional effort to do this or it doesn't take like you know some uh     
35:36     
complex process It just requires some brownie emotion Uh but that's why they     
35:43     
you know if if things are very big you can't have things packed that tightly so     
35:48     
that it enables that sort of function And in a smaller cell things are packed in more tightly So you can have these     
35:56     
opportunities inside a cell Nearly everything happens by chance encounters amongst these molecules So chance     
36:02     
encounters I think is a key word here or the key phrase As a cell volume grows     
36:08     
the chance for any given encounter diminishes assuming the numbers of molecules stay constant And so the diffusion rate of     
36:16     
molecules are just on several factors And this is also the other important part is that molecular diffusion is not     
36:22     
a constant It's it's broadly motion but the rate at which it's produced and diffuses is also you know variable and     
36:31     
can play a role So you can have larger cells with a higher diffusion rate and     
36:37     
the diffusion rate can keep up up to a point So uh so for instance the     
36:42     
cytoplasm is extremely crowded So molecules spend lots of time ricocheting off obstacles delaying their arrival at     
36:50     
a distant location Every protein in the cell collides with about 10 billion water molecules per second on average     
36:57     
These frequent collisions mean that the vast majority of proteins in a bacterium for example only diffuse between 5 and     
37:04     
10 nanometers squared per second So that's you know with respect to the size     
37:10     
of the cell um you know it isn't that large but again if there's if there are     
37:15     
a lot of things packed inside the cell then that's enough space Some molecules     
37:21     
also aggregate or stick to the change to charge surfaces further slowing their     
37:27     
movement Molecules move very slowly near the densely packed nucleoid for example     
37:33     
In general larger molecules diffuse more sluggishly than smaller ones So this gives the example of     
37:40     
metabolites decolide which can diffuse from one side of the cell to the other in     
37:45     
milliseconds which means collisions and cellular outcomes occur quickly So you     
37:50     
know there are these uh in C elegance you have this mechanism where by the rotor uh the fleeller rotor     
37:59     
moves uh and you have these molecules that go from the sort of the head to the     
38:05     
tail and they kind of bounce around the inside of the cell They have to bind with the receptors on the inside of the     
38:13     
fleeller motor to make it work And so this is something that happens through     
38:18     
um basically by chance through uh diffusion And so that's an example of     
38:26     
some function that this sort of diffusion diffusive process Tablets are     
38:31     
another example where you get this sort of you know these collisions that have     
38:36     
to occur and you know they can occur by chance enough to make something happen     
38:44     
A typical protein takes just 0.01 seconds to traverse a bacteria in its     
38:49     
diameter about one micrometer or micron But the same protein would take around     
38:55     
four minutes to move one millimeter and more than six hours to move one centimeter This is in part why cells are     
39:02     
so tight So this graph is measured diffusion rate versus molecular weight     
39:08     
So this is an E.coli And this is where we have uh proteins of different diffusion rates     
39:17     
and molecular weights So each protein's diffusion weight or diffusion rate is     
39:22     
measured in cytoplasm using fluorescent correlation spectroscopy So these are the different     
39:28     
proteins here labeled or the the dots are proteins and we have some labelled     
39:34     
proteins Then we have this uh constant diffusion rate function microns per     
39:39     
second squared and that goes downward as we go along this uh x- axis which is     
39:47     
diffusion rate Then we have our mass kilodolton on the y axis and we see that     
39:54     
as the mass decreases the diffusion rate increases and as the diffusion rate decreases the mass increases with some     
40:01     
variation So some proteins uh deviate from this function more than others But     
40:07     
basically the idea is that the larger or the heavier the protein the molecular     
40:14     
weight the slower the diffusion rate That makes sense If you have something that's lighter travels faster If you     
40:22     
have like ping pong balls versus like a a ping pong table or a ping pong paddle     
40:30     
if you kind of threw them up in the air you know you kind of let them kind of diffuse If they got     
40:37     
caught up like in a tornado or something uh you know there the the diffusion rate     
40:43     
might be higher So um this is a a good example of     
40:49     
how this works And this is just a physical constraint So this would happen in any organism cell and this happens     
40:57     
uniformly across cells The diffusion rate of of uh you know it depends on the     
41:03     
medium I think as well So there's some difference but usually this the medium inside the cells it's like I don't know     
41:10     
what if they're huge differences in diffusion rate across different cells     
41:17     
Um so yeah So what with these constraints in mind we can begin to speculate as to why various cells are     
41:22     
shaped the way they are Red blood cells are tiny and shaped like bio concave discs This aids with diffusion So it's     
41:29     
the shape of the actual thing that's diffusing By abandoning a spherical     
41:35     
shape and evolving towards more of a donut they increase their surface area without compromising their compact     
41:41     
volume This in turn enhances their ability to exchange oxygen with cells in     
41:46     
the body Their small size eight micrometers across also helps them move     
41:52     
through the narrow cap Uh in contrast oites can grow so large around 100     
41:58     
micrometers in diameter in part because they are less metabolically active than other types of human cells thus don't     
42:05     
depend so much on random collisions So they're actually less metabolically     
42:10     
active by nature and so they can have this very large size without losing much function Um they stockpile nutrients     
42:18     
durogenesis They wait out fertilization Ukarotic cells also grow large in     
42:23     
general because they evolved compartmentalization So they modularize specific functions into organels and so     
42:31     
this limits the amount of diffusion that needs to happen locally for some function to happen     
42:37     
And it also allows for set So that's good And that's basically     
42:44     
the article uh as I want to do So let's see We have some things in     
42:50     
the chat So Dick says that there is at least one archa that seems to have no     
42:56     
control over cell size It's interesting Um some archa make transitions between     
43:02     
spherical and flat polygonal I've calculated for one cell the volume reduces by a factor of     
43:08     
68 It's also interesting U blood cells become cupshaped in capillaries possibly     
43:16     
increasing gas exchange Yeah that's we're talking about in the     
43:23     
example Okay Um yeah so that's good Any     
43:28     
other questions     
43:36     
okay Uh yeah So I mean it's it's an interesting article and viewed in light     
43:42     
of the other article in terms of speed limit of uh cell division I think that's     
43:47     
really interesting So uh as Press they have     
43:54     
this series on quantifying the cell So I thought that was really interesting as     
44:00     
to how they're kind of approaching this So actually I wanted to point out a     
44:05     
paper that Susan sent Um and I don't know if we covered this before but this     
44:11     
is a paper from PNAS This is on cell contraction induces     
44:18     
long range stress stiffening in the extracellular matrix So this is uh I     
44:24     
don't want to cover this this week but we can cover it at another time Um this     
44:29     
talks about how animal cells and tissues are supported by bio uh polymer matrices     
44:36     
which typically exhibit highly nonlinear mechanical properties Uh we don't know how cells in     
44:43     
turn affect nonlinear mechanics of their surrounding matrix So in this paper they show that living contractile cells are     
44:51     
able to generate massive stiffness gradient and three distinct 3D     
44:57     
extracellular matrix model systems these collagen fibin matriel which is     
45:05     
artificial type matrix We decipher this remarkable behavior by introducing     
45:11     
nonlinear stress interference microscopy which is NSI a technique used to infer     
45:17     
stress fields in a 3D matrix or nonlinear micro realology measurements     
45:24     
with optical tweezers This is a specific type of uh force microscopy they're     
45:29     
using using NSIM in simulations we reveal large long ranged cell generated     
45:36     
stress capable of buckling filaments in the matrix So we can have these cell     
45:41     
generated stresses that are long range large stresses that can buckle filaments     
45:46     
in the matrix These stresses give rise to the large spatial extent of the observed cylinders     
45:52     
matrix stiffness gradient which can provide a mechanism for mechanical communication between     
45:58     
cells So this is did you have any words on this Susan     
46:07     
paper words i don't know Um I do know that the um     
46:16     
matrix for the basement membrane um has a what is called a J curve like     
46:24     
it changes from um changes slope the     
46:30     
elasticity changes um with uh increasing     
46:38     
um strain or stress So it's um starts off at one     
46:44     
slope and then changes So it's a steeper slope It's a sort of a J shape on a     
46:53     
stress drain curve So that that affects um the     
46:58     
elasticity of the overall um tissue which is important in     
47:04     
development for sure     
47:09     
Yeah Yeah So this is just kind of showing these they have an experimental test bed     
47:15     
They show kind of the range of different uh forces that are transmitted long     
47:21     
range cell generated stresses So was saying that can we make     
47:26     
changes to the uh filaments uh by kind of inducing     
47:33     
stresses and then you know this is something that happens in the cell uh where they're they're contracting kind     
47:40     
of due to maybe some environmental force or some signal that they're getting from     
47:45     
other cells and then they're able forces     
47:53     
and that's another way of uh cells communicating with each other so that     
47:59     
they can use it Well that's good Thank you Susan     
48:05     
I mean to call on you but Oh well that's okay     
48:13     
Um my my thesis shows that is the     
48:19     
um attachments cells have to the basement membrane and to each other are     
48:27     
important for the overall uh tissue elasticity     
48:33     
All right Um so I don't know we might go over that paper in more detail next week I just     
48:39     
wanted to bring it up now Um so the last thing I want to talk about today is this paper     
48:45     
um on ary bacteria and how we get these almost     
48:51     
tissue like structures It's I guess a form I guess a form of     
49:00     
multisellularity And multisellularity is interesting because you can achieve that in numerous ways It's not a hard and     
49:07     
fast thing It's it's a one of the transitions of evolution that we have     
49:12     
but it's also uh you can achieve it in multiple ways where we have this sort of     
49:17     
tissue like multiselliular development So it's not a tissue but it's it's like     
49:23     
a tissue behaves like a tissue and this is triggered by mechanical compression in archa So this is where you have this     
49:31     
mechanical compression that you can introduce and it can uh form these     
49:36     
struct these structures that are you know they're they're clonal what they call clonal     
49:42     
multisellularity okay so this is in     
49:48     
um I think it's in science yeah it's latest issue of science     
49:55     
uh in the abstract reads the advent of multi clonal multisellular literary is a critical evolutionary milestone     
50:02     
seen often in ukarots rarely in bacteria only once in our key So this is one of     
50:09     
these transitions of evolution uh where you have go from like single cells living in isolation Maybe they'll live     
50:16     
in you know there's a kind of a fuzzy boundary where they live in colonies but the colonies are not you know uh     
50:23     
integrated in terms of you know what I think we've talked about this before in     
50:29     
terms of metabolism and other things and then eventually you get these structures that     
50:34     
multisellular that where they're you know actually dependent on one another     
50:40     
and then of course you get embryos and things like that So this is a major transition in the evolution of life     
50:46     
because it allowed for these multisellular organisms to emerge and so you don't see this you see this sort of     
50:55     
in well um yeast are ukarotes and people have done a lot of work in yeast yeast     
51:02     
are ukarotes that are single cell and they are single cell usually but they     
51:08     
form colonies and moreover they form these kind of clumps or clusters ers that are sort of multisellular because     
51:15     
you can induce multisellular in bacteria you don't really see uh multisellularity as much     
51:22     
you see some and then this is uh talking about our key which is you know not     
51:27     
bacteria it's ary bacteria so it's very rare in our community in this case what they're     
51:33     
doing is they're inducing multisod so they show that unaxial compression induces clonal     
51:40     
multisellularity and hallow This is specific type of archae bacteria     
51:45     
forming tissue like structures and then they say tissue like it's something in biology where you     
51:53     
don't want to go all the way and say it's a tissue and have people try to like confirm it's a tissue through     
52:00     
experiments then you just say tissue like and people will know kind of what you're what it's supposed to be like but     
52:06     
it's less rigorous in any case it's tissue like so don't get too excited Um     
52:13     
these archal tissues are mechanically and molecular distinct from the urinous     
52:18     
cellular lifestyle and making several ukarotic features So these have sort of these     
52:25     
ukareotic features that emerge once they're this type of multisellular     
52:31     
uh structure So it suggests that um we have this sort of dependence that     
52:37     
emerges not you know due to any inherent feature of ukarotic cells but it's an     
52:43     
inherent feature of multisellularity Our keal tissues     
52:49     
undergo a multi-ucleate stage followed by a tubulant independent     
52:55     
cellularization orchestrated by an active memory tension After     
53:01     
cellularization tissue junction elasticity becomes akin to that of animal tissues giving rise to two cell     
53:09     
types they call peripheral cell types central scutinid cell types with     
53:15     
distinct actin and protein glyization polarity So this means is that you have these     
53:22     
multisellular collectives tissue and they form these     
53:27     
different cell types like basically the cell types are driven by this sort of     
53:34     
these mechanical forces this tissue junction elasticity and uh different aspects of     
53:41     
membrane proteins configuring themselves in different ways So we have these peripheral cells and central scuttoid     
53:47     
cells So it's like we have the central zone and the peripheral zones So we're getting this sort of specialization     
53:54     
already in these kind of structures and there are different distinct patterns of     
54:02     
glycization Our findings highlight the potential convergent evolution of biohysical mechanism in the emergence of     
54:10     
multisellular systems in most So I mean the question I have here is     
54:16     
this something that's something that is unique to these cells It's like a behavioral mode of     
54:23     
this species of ary bacteria or is this something you can induce all ary     
54:29     
bacteria i suspect it's maybe a a function of the specific species that     
54:34     
they have here So let's see here     
54:39     
Um so they talk about multisellularity um and they talk about arch bacteria is     
54:47     
how they're distinct from bacteria uh but they have this so basically archa     
54:54     
are now recognized as a monopilotic group with ukarotes So they actually are     
55:00     
closer to ukarotes than they are to bacteria post archa lacer rigid cell bulb and are     
55:08     
encapsulated by proteinous surface monollayer esator a two-dimensional     
55:15     
paracrystalline lattice composed of glyco so this is this es so they don't     
55:21     
have a rigid cell wall but they have this esator so that's the thing that's     
55:27     
different so and I say that arch bacteria are closer to ukarotes and bacteria they're is this     
55:35     
modifi So they're going to be very different than ukarots It's just that they're uh their classification is such     
55:44     
that they're grouped with ukarots So this might suggest that you see some properties of     
55:50     
ukarotic cells in bacteria But anyways um so you have although the archal     
55:58     
envelope structure is thought to make cells mechanically vulnerable So this specialized or this envelope structure     
56:05     
instead of having the rigid cell wall it may make cells mechanically vulnerable     
56:10     
It also facilitates pulse interactions between cells such as cell cell contact     
56:15     
fusion which may have played a role in the emergence of ukarots So this is interesting because it suggests that     
56:22     
this monopolyic origin is sort of means that archy bacteria or the common     
56:28     
ancestor between archy bacteria and ukarotes also had something similar to this sort of s layer instead of a rigid     
56:35     
cell wall and then the rigid cell wall developer evolved independently in uh     
56:42     
ukarots So we don't know that but that's kind of what it's suggesting So this S     
56:49     
layer may be you know sort of a standin for a rigid cell Although the archo envelope     
56:55     
structure is thought to make cells mechanically vulnerable We talked about that However the evolution of mechanory     
57:02     
responses driven by the lack of rigid cell remains elusive only to the     
57:07     
scarcity of individ Peculiar combination of genetic and biohysical traits prompted us to     
57:14     
investigate the mechanobiology of archal cells leading to the serendipitous     
57:19     
discovery of a reversible clonal tissue like multisellular developmental program     
57:25     
So ah this is interesting So there's this they propose to be a developmental program multisellular development     
57:32     
program in archal cells or in this mechanobiology of archa cells     
57:39     
So um they performed their experiments in the salt loving alooferax volcani     
57:46     
which H4 or HVO which is specific species of ary bacteria     
57:53     
leveraging it straightforward cultivation and genetics So this is a model organism within archy bacteria you     
58:00     
know we don't know I guess if this is true across Larch bacteria but in this     
58:05     
species we do have this sort of program um first we established a baseline for     
58:11     
mechanically unperturbed helal cells trapped within arc cell custom     
58:16     
micrfluidic devices cell in a device that where you can introduce different     
58:22     
types of laminer turbulent flows and measure the effects of different um     
58:28     
liquids and and chemical compounds you know kind of you can fix the cell and have these     
58:35     
flows and do things like that So you can actually get some good interesting     
58:42     
measurements of mechanical interactions Um cells growing in arc cells show cell     
58:48     
morphologies comparable to those involve liquid cultures indicating no mechanical     
58:53     
stress Next we image cells under agros pads a standard technique in microbial     
59:00     
normalization So they used arc cell which is the micrfluidic device These aggro pads which is sort of the in     
59:08     
control these aggros pads deform cells within a single generation which is 2.5     
59:15     
hours at the lowest aggros concentrations making pad immovalization     
59:20     
incompatible with prolonged imaging to quantify the compressive forces deforming cells We measured the pad     
59:28     
elasticity So they just talked about their method here um storage module we have 0.25 to 3.5%     
59:37     
pads revealed resistance forces of around 10 kilopascals and those are     
59:42     
sufficient enough to deform HVO cells These values suggest that HVO cells may     
59:48     
have visco elastic properties close to that of ukarotic cells such as amoeba or     
59:53     
mamalian cells but orders of magnitude lower than those of most cellwalled     
59:59     
organisms So cell weld organisms are like plants and other types of     
1:00:06     
ukarotes that have rigids like you know we have plants and animal membranes So     
1:00:14     
basically plant-like membranes Given the mechanical sensitivity of heliocheal cells under     
1:00:22     
pads we tested these responses of HVO to compress the forces above 100     
1:00:28     
kilopascals closer to forces experienced in their natural habitat um such as the human gut or salt     
1:00:35     
Following compression under pads with aggress concentrations of 1.5% and higher cells stop dividing but continue     
1:00:43     
to grow After around 12 hours cellularization occurs via simultaneous     
1:00:49     
uh septation events resulting in epithelial like monollayer structures So     
1:00:54     
this is where we've uh introduced these compressive forces above 100 kilopascals     
1:01:00     
These are forces that you see in nature and then you have this compression Um I guess this is where you     
1:01:10     
observe this sort of cellularization after about 12 hours and you end up with these monollayer structures These tissue     
1:01:17     
like ensembles resemble radial tessillation patterns and leaf tissues and multisellular green algae again this     
1:01:25     
parallel with uh ukareotic cells and algae Um and so you have the sort of     
1:01:34     
u you get like you know different types of formation uh sort of physical     
1:01:40     
responses to the same thing So this suggests that maybe there's some parallel or that     
1:01:47     
they're very similar sorts of structures that have some common evolutionary answers The morphological development     
1:01:54     
before cellularization also resembles the co-enccyic phase of chitrids and     
1:02:01     
chicken embryogenesis in which cells multiply their nuclei without cell division So this is again this sort     
1:02:09     
of cential uh developmental stage So this is where you get this     
1:02:17     
uh you know this this sort of another parallel with ukarotes Timelapse imaging of cells     
1:02:23     
expressing neog green PCNA shows continuous replication during development uh supporting a coincidy     
1:02:31     
like phase preceding cellularization So then animal and plant cells often     
1:02:37     
sense and activate biochemical pathways in response to surface curvatures     
1:02:42     
material properties of the membranes To test influence or material properties of     
1:02:48     
the substrate and surface curvature of the membranes to test the influence of the pad stiffness we immobilized HVO     
1:02:55     
cells under and on top of the same agros pad As a result tissues are observed     
1:03:01     
exclusively under the pads suggesting that stiffness alone is not sufficient to induce multisellularity So this is     
1:03:08     
where we don't just need stiffness we need something else Furthermore more cells compressed     
1:03:15     
by different bilayer cake pad setups So they're compressing with these two     
1:03:20     
aguros cakes pushing them down They're uh you you know stiffness isn't enough     
1:03:28     
So what else do we need um so uh you develop into tissue-l like     
1:03:35     
structures only when under compression by at least one stiff surface ruling out a specific role of the cover slip other     
1:03:42     
than providing a rigid surface for compression Finally tissue formation is     
1:03:48     
independent of gravity pad mass or thickness consistently initiated at the     
1:03:53     
same uh coincidic area regardless of pad density So these analogous features     
1:03:59     
suggest that the archal tissue development represents an evolved biological program response to     
1:04:06     
compression So again it isn't enough to have stiffness need     
1:04:11     
compression Um and then they did some other experiments here These are some     
1:04:16     
images here where you get these So this is the where they have PDMS which is the     
1:04:24     
uh micrfluidic environment and then the aggros pads which are the compressor they trap them in the PDMS and then they     
1:04:31     
compress them with aggros pads they allowed the cell to sit there and then     
1:04:37     
there was diffusion of the cell uh between the pads and then they show this     
1:04:42     
these different morphologies of the cells here are the trap cells the PDMS     
1:04:49     
where they're kind coming together in these colonies You have the compressed uh state by the     
1:04:56     
agros pads So this is where we have the unicell with the coen site the     
1:05:03     
cellularization in the tissue So you see there are these different stages of multisellularization where you have     
1:05:09     
cellularization then you have this tissue formation You have then this uh this is     
1:05:15     
another one where you have the S layer and then that leads to the tissue stage     
1:05:21     
there where you have cellularization It looks like it might be crack formation     
1:05:28     
Yeah maybe I don't know what's going on there but     
1:05:34     
uh yeah and then they just show some other uh some other things from their     
1:05:40     
experiments They have me membrane displacement in microns time after ablation in seconds So you can see they     
1:05:47     
did some ablation experiments and they had this membrane displacement for the tissue versus the unicell the tissue you     
1:05:54     
get much more membrane displacement after ablation So that's I'm not really sure what they     
1:06:01     
were doing there I don't want to go over too much of you know the detail what they did Uh but they basically did laser     
1:06:07     
ablation of tissue regions and so that I mean I guess you take out like a piece     
1:06:13     
of the of the culture and then you fill in I guess because tissues will fill in     
1:06:19     
you know you have you can have uh cell division that fill in gaps and cell     
1:06:24     
culture but if you have like a tissue layer actually fills in and and the     
1:06:30     
membrane gets displaced in a different way So this is maybe what's going on here Um and so this just shows again the     
1:06:39     
tissue versus the unicels The tissue have the structure We have the two different cell types the edge cells and     
1:06:46     
then the inner cells here And then this is the unicell where you don't have that sort of uh you know functional     
1:06:53     
distinction It's just a collection of cells in a cluster So you can see the     
1:06:58     
difference there Okay So that's uh figure one Um     
1:07:08     
and so then they say archal tissues are widespread in helioarcha and counter cororrelate with     
1:07:14     
bofilm production So this is interesting that they want to know like in helioarchchial tissues What is the     
1:07:21     
evolutionary diversity so they constructed a phoggenomic tree spanning 57 genre representing all helioarchal     
1:07:30     
quarters imaging compressed cells from 52 species across 14 genre regardless of     
1:07:36     
cell size or growth rate 61.6% of tested heliochial species form tissues That's     
1:07:43     
it a pretty high rate for uh so this is something that you see across Helioarchchal plate So it's like this     
1:07:51     
group uh within ary bacteria it's helarchal salt loving and then 61.6 six     
1:07:59     
of those species for tissues with at least one instance of tissue development     
1:08:04     
or no multisellularity in every tested genus So this is something that's both     
1:08:10     
common but also commonly lost in different genre So this is something     
1:08:16     
that is uh you know it's obviously maybe something that's uh shared by the common     
1:08:24     
ancestor of helio bacteria but or helio archa but it's uh not you know it maybe     
1:08:32     
it's environmentally contingent uh among among non-forming tissue strains we identify cases of cell death     
1:08:40     
shape deformation and unnoticeable shape deformations under pads     
1:08:45     
for the agar pads We also observed three strains uh HTG Selena and CC Jotali and     
1:08:54     
HK Jotali that exhibited aggressive multisellular     
1:08:59     
multisellularity similar to that of methanosina the only previously reported     
1:09:05     
multisellular archa These results suggest that archal tissues emerge early in ho archal     
1:09:12     
evolution and remain dominant in the cycle diversity as I was saying Um next     
1:09:17     
we focus on strains from the haloax genus in which hfx uh pravalence     
1:09:23     
produces large deformed tissue structures whereas HFX Mediterraneani     
1:09:29     
and gibsoni failed to develop growing or failed to develop growing instead of     
1:09:35     
stack colonies So you get these different types of morphologies Um and this suggests that     
1:09:42     
this sort of multisellularity maybe you know isn't as tissue- like as we like to     
1:09:48     
think because you get these different maybe it's like an intermediate between colonies and tissues where you get these     
1:09:54     
different morphologies that are sort of maybe ad hoc tissues or something that     
1:09:59     
is both resembling a colony and a tissue So when they fail to develop they grow     
1:10:05     
these stacked colonies Uh and that's that's another uh     
1:10:10     
piece of diversity there that's interesting Although all three Ts are closely related each met is placed on     
1:10:17     
the long branch which means that there's more evolutionary space between that and the other members of its uh genus     
1:10:25     
suggesting an extended time for adaptation following the loss or gain of genetic material     
1:10:31     
So this is again they do a lot of evolutionary studies here This shows the     
1:10:37     
fogyny where they kind of they they know the fogyny they did the experiments in     
1:10:43     
all these species within this genus and they they saw these results and so this     
1:10:49     
is again we get this S layer you get this growth over time and you get these     
1:10:55     
different morphologies Okay And then um figure     
1:11:00     
three shows that cellularization is independent of fitz z's and result fitz     
1:11:06     
zs and results in two cell types So this is again where fits z is the protein     
1:11:12     
that enables cell division and so you know you have this protein in rings that     
1:11:18     
enclose the cell or enclose the cell membrane cell division and so pinches it     
1:11:24     
off So you would imagine that cellular this is involved in cellularization but it's actually independent of that     
1:11:31     
protein's expression So you get these different multisellular or     
1:11:37     
cellularization mechanisms So this is an example here of where you have the     
1:11:42     
tissue where you have the peripheral cells and the scuttoid cells The scuttoid cells are just smaller We     
1:11:49     
talked about this before where there's more constrained cell morphologies and they're in this sort of arrangement in     
1:11:55     
the middle where they're compressed then the peripheral cells are wider and     
1:12:00     
they're along the edge and so they're under different types of compression So you get these different types of cells     
1:12:06     
and then this is where they're imaging fitz Z and they show in the unicell case     
1:12:13     
where there's a ring of fit Z in the middle and then in the kanocy it's kind of diffuse cellularization it's in the     
1:12:20     
middle peak cellularization it's along the boundaries in here and then then the     
1:12:25     
tissue you see fits Z being expressed along the membranes I guess and it's just kind of     
1:12:33     
showing the difference and how it's expressed So in the unicell case it's getting ready for cell division where     
1:12:39     
the unicell is dividing two cells The fit z ring is poised for that But in     
1:12:45     
these other cases you don't see that that sort of need for conventional cell     
1:12:51     
division you have something else going I guess that's what's going um and     
1:12:58     
so you have fit Z1 being expressed across different developmental stages     
1:13:05     
and that's what you're seeing here Um so yeah this is um basically and then     
1:13:12     
finally archo tissue cellularization is triggered by envelope tension So what     
1:13:18     
we're basically finding is that and this is uh put in the context of ukarotes So     
1:13:26     
evidence from flies and holoans suggests that the timing of cellularization correlates with a specific threshold     
1:13:33     
ratio between the number of nuclei per cell volume This is in like you know in     
1:13:41     
a cential cell before cellularization and then that     
1:13:46     
cellularization is triggered So applies you have this process and you know you     
1:13:52     
get this uh these nuclei per volume and then you reach a specific number of     
1:13:57     
nuclei per volume you get the cellularization and it's like we were talking about with limits to the size of     
1:14:04     
a single cell you get this sort of thing so by imaging HVO cells expressing     
1:14:10     
amnneon green PCNA we quantified the number of replication sites fluoresence     
1:14:16     
intensity within replication sites relative to cell area as a proxy for N/     
1:14:21     
C If N / C is critical for cellularization DNA replication would     
1:14:26     
increase faster than cell area However the signal at replication sites remain     
1:14:32     
constant relative to cell area indicating that N slash C does not influence     
1:14:37     
cellularization So this is again where they wanted to know more about solularization and the nuclei per cell     
1:14:44     
volume which is N / C And so this does not influence cellularization in in the     
1:14:51     
paleo park bacteria as opposed to what we see     
1:14:57     
in metazones Uh next we track single cell parameters such as size time and the     
1:15:04     
amount of added cell volume at cellularization observing a lower coefficient of variance for cell area     
1:15:11     
compared to area added in time respectively So this is where you um you     
1:15:19     
know they want to look at different things that contribute to cellularization and they wanted to see     
1:15:27     
if there was some cell critical cell size that needs to be reached So you     
1:15:32     
know before you get cellularization so they compressed some of these unic cells     
1:15:37     
This resulted in cellularization around 4.2 two times faster with three 3.7     
1:15:43     
times less added area compared to wild type at a consistent cell size So they     
1:15:50     
were able to induce this in the unicell using compression and getting a regular     
1:15:55     
result So that means that there's something going on between     
1:16:01     
um this sort of uh you know compression and uh these     
1:16:08     
other mechanisms of cellularization where they're not really sure what's going but um and then so this this is     
1:16:15     
figure four tissue cellularization is triggered by coincidic size through a     
1:16:21     
memory tension threshold So there's something going on with membrane tension that triggers this process Okay So why     
1:16:28     
don't we uh stop there and so I know Susan maybe or Dick wants to say     
1:16:34     
something about this or anyone's welcome to say something     
1:16:45     
It would be interesting to look at crack formation um with regards to where where the     
1:16:53     
divisions occur but other than that nothing's coming to mind this morning     
1:17:00     
Okay     
1:17:07     
Bradley Uh this particular archa uh     
1:17:12     
genus uh comes from the Dead Sea uh in     
1:17:17     
Israel and uh was disco it's actually the first one discovered around the 40s     
1:17:23     
in the 40s uh it produces many polygonal     
1:17:30     
cells and yet I don't see polygonal cells in these     
1:17:35     
tissues at least I had glance of them I I haven't done a thorough search Yeah     
1:17:43     
Uh so the the uh relationship to this to     
1:17:48     
the polygonal cells would be interesting to know Yeah     
1:17:54     
Okay Uh I guess that's my only comment Uh I did come across this paper a couple     
1:18:00     
of days ago so there's a word of it but uh I didn't make as much as you did of     
1:18:05     
it Uh yeah I'm not sure what the role of     
1:18:12     
the S layer is There's a lot of speculation that it that it acts like a     
1:18:19     
cell wall Uh but there's no evidence Uh I've concluded have you ever     
1:18:26     
made a bubble raft uh just bubbles flipping on top of water Yeah Yeah Yeah     
1:18:32     
Okay You'll notice that if you stick your finger in it wet that it's very easy to move it around So it acts more     
1:18:39     
like a liquid than a solid even though it looks crystal crystalline Uh and I     
1:18:45     
suspect that's true of the S layer The uh the S layer uh can probably move     
1:18:52     
around Uh it certainly I've predicted it has different configurations at the     
1:18:58     
edges and corners of the polygons it makes And you can I can actually     
1:19:05     
calculate the on assuming that there's a different energy for S layer molecules     
1:19:11     
at the surface at the edges and corners of polygons I can calculate shape the     
1:19:17     
shapes Uh so uh     
1:19:23     
it I'm not sure what's going on with with the uh uh     
1:19:29     
multisellularity and I'm not sure there's any natural conditions under which you get the compression that they     
1:19:36     
have artificially generated Yeah Uh so uh uh there there might be some     
1:19:44     
uh how what do you call it uh uh oh the term that uh G invented I'm     
1:19:53     
trying to remember it uh the one for pre-addaptations like exaptation     
1:19:59     
exaptations is that it okay yes uh so it might be one of these things that's     
1:20:06     
developed for another reason but then prove useful for multisellularity     
1:20:12     
uh there's no evidence uh in collections of these cells or cultures of them of     
1:20:19     
multisellularity So the compression seems to be essential and artificial     
1:20:25     
[Music] Would it have anything to do with um     
1:20:30     
bact bacteria forming uh films no not at all     
1:20:36     
bacteria See contrary to the general statement the bacteria do have rigid     
1:20:41     
cell walls which can support up to 50 atmospheres of pressure in them Archa     
1:20:51     
especially these archa have zero In other words they're they're there's     
1:20:58     
no osmolarity at all No osmalerity affected them at all     
1:21:05     
Uh so we're very very different from bacteria that way Bacteria are sort of     
1:21:11     
little high pressure bombs     
1:21:18     
Okay And they some of them do indeed uh are     
1:21:25     
multisellular In fact there's even one that's weirdly that's oblig obligatorily multisellular In other     
1:21:32     
words it forms a little ball of cells and it reproduces as the ball of cells So you never see an individual     
1:21:39     
individual cell Okay uh so uh you know if     
1:21:49     
uh uh there     
1:21:54     
uh I've got pictures of this in this book Okay uh if anyone want wants to follow     
1:22:02     
it up Uh so uh I how should I say uh it's a     
1:22:10     
very interesting result which I take with a grain of salt Yeah Yeah That's probably a good way to put it     
1:22:18     
Okay All right um the     
1:22:25     
um tissue like formation would be stronger than um individual cells like     
1:22:33     
that That would be an interesting thing to look at     
1:22:39     
How that changes the strength of the um of the     
1:22:45     
cells collectively if they're attached to each other     
1:22:52     
Oh and by the way on the previous stuff on diffusion uh as I said some of the archa such as     
1:22:59     
the ones in this paper uh form these very flat cells     
1:23:05     
And uh with uh much smaller volume but with     
1:23:11     
uh how should I say the surface area per per volume uh uh is much     
1:23:18     
larger And it's speculated that this might allow them to capture more     
1:23:24     
molecules or more sunlight or something Okay uh     
1:23:31     
uh because uh the membranes may be permeable to uh small ions and other     
1:23:37     
molecules     
1:23:44     
Okay but they're very peculiar cells They they exist in saturated salt water     
1:23:53     
No other know there's much higher much higher than the ocean water Uh they have no osmolarity They have     
1:24:00     
these peculiar shapes So sort of things about them Uh and uh uh and yes it's     
1:24:09     
true that people believe that ukariots came from a fusion of archa and bacteria     
1:24:16     
uh but uh whether that's related to this compression phenomena or not is not     
1:24:23     
obvious Yeah Yeah Uh so I'd say we're still dealing with     
1:24:30     
an unsolved problem Yeah     
1:24:36     
Okay I guess that I guess that's it So that's that's good Yeah Thanks     
1:24:43     
Yes That's good And of course Yeah So if you're if you're uh new to the     
1:24:50     
group you know a lot of terms that got to run around that maybe you're not familiar with but way I view that is     
1:24:57     
just keep attending the meetings you know read the paper if you want and you     
1:25:02     
know eventually you'll kind of get fun stuff     
1:25:08     
Yeah Bradley there's also one thing I wanted to bring up the uh you know I     
1:25:14     
made this analogy between shape droplets     
1:25:19     
which between shape droplets and uh uh archa that are polygonal uh have     
1:25:27     
similar shapes but the uh the size of the shape droplets have     
1:25:33     
been shown to be as small as 600     
1:25:39     
molecules Okay which isn't incredibly small It's too small obviously for much metabolism to occur in if if if it     
1:25:46     
developed from that Uh but it's suggestive that the lower limit for the     
1:25:52     
size of the cell might be much     
1:25:58     
smaller Okay Uh in other words you can get little triangles of these shaped     
1:26:03     
droplets down to 600 molecules     
1:26:09     
Okay Which is incredible Okay So I I leave that     
1:26:15     
question open also     
1:26:21     
Yeah All right So uh one final thing I wanted to mention before we go If you're     
1:26:26     
doing Google Summer of Code applications your proposals those are due I think     
1:26:32     
today Uh you'll have to check the date on the website um I think it's the 7th     
1:26:38     
Um and then I don't remember what the time is the deadline I think it's um UTC     
1:26:45     
So please check with your local time to make sure you make the deadline And then     
1:26:50     
we'll be evaluating applications um and then making decisions by uh I     
1:26:58     
think May 1st Oh April 8th 1800 UTC So it's tomorrow or I guess Yeah I guess     
1:27:05     
for everyone's tomorrow Um yeah So please get those in on time to be considered and then we'll be making     
1:27:13     
decisions I think they're released like May 2nd I don't know what the date is but um and then you know if you don't     
1:27:19     
get selected because we don't know how many slots we're going to get then you you you could still pursue your project     
1:27:27     
um you know without being formally selected for G There are ways we've done this in the past with students and so um     
1:27:36     
you know don't feel too bad if you don't get selected Sometimes we only get one slot so it might be uh we might not get     
1:27:44     
selected even if you have a great application So uh good luck to everyone     
1:27:50     
and uh look forward to seeing your uh proposals and um yeah so that's all for     
1:27:58     
today Um thank you for attending See you next week
