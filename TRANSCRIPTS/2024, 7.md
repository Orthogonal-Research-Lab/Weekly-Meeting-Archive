hello hi somebody wants me done with my project this week and everybody in my     
0:05     
family thinks it's a holiday the whole week the whole     
0:11     
week helloo hello I woke up late so can     
0:17     
see hello     
0:22     
hello yeah everyone oh um anyway okay     
0:29     
well welcome to the meeting uh yeah welcome a and vahed and Susan and Dick     
0:36     
and Morgan uh didn't anyone have anything they wanted to bring up in the     
0:41     
meeting uh uh probably I can tell something okay     
0:47     
so BR I was actually going through your paper uh the last year paper which names hypergraphs demonstrate uh anestos     
0:55     
during divers integration so yeah that's an interesting paper I like I read about     
1:01     
hypergraphs there so there were two typ of hypergraph which I didn't know before and I am from computational back     
1:06     
basically so I got to know more about biology and how like C Elegance are so     
1:13     
important like like like how we Divine bi biology into different parts and by using C Elegance we can study human     
1:20     
biology and diseases like Parkinson it was very fascinating well that's good yeah yeah     
1:27     
we don't talk about that so much in the group but it's it's it's definitely something they they Model A number of     
1:33     
diseases and seans and a number of different physiological processes um so     
1:40     
yeah it's definitely something you can follow up on if you know there's a lot of literature on it I don't know if it's     
1:47     
something you're interested in but whatever you're interested in um yeah and so that's I     
1:55     
see yeah I see there a bunch of your papers also so I had a list of them but I haven't gone through all right now     
2:03     
yeah please read those um over if if you if you find something really interesting it'll be helpful in terms of maybe what     
2:11     
you might want to do in the group so yeah it'll definitely background for     
2:18     
it yeah yeah so we had a number of people in the slack where they were     
2:24     
asking for you know they were asking about things and I'm going to be putting up     
2:30     
uh some I I think we have some things pinned in the slack channel uh first of     
2:36     
all so there are some resources in the they should be pinned if they're not I'll make sure that they are uh links to     
2:42     
different things and and we have onboarding guides and different places where we're doing work in you know like     
2:49     
things like GitHub repositories and websites and things like that so if     
2:54     
people are interested in participating you know join our slack and check out     
2:59     
the pin materials and uh in the next few weeks I'll be going over some of those things that we've been uh you know that     
3:07     
that may be of use to getting oriented in the group so that's good well thank you     
3:16     
Mah uh yeah I actually saw that yeah Jiang has p a lot of things P DJ library     
3:23     
and few papers also hyperbolic oh yeah yeah I'll go through     
3:28     
it all right uh yeah so Ved said or dick     
3:35     
says Ved is making great progress on reconstruction of an image from lines taken across     
3:45     
it so did you want to talk about that a little bit     
3:51     
or uh yeah actually I'm now this working     
3:56     
on both this work and another work that we have been talking regarding the development of 302     
4:04     
something oh c302 yeah and it's     
4:11     
uh how it could be connected to uh Dev uh as the     
4:17     
TR uh yeah I have I've done something on both of them uh these days and I can uh     
4:25     
talk about them actually uh regarding uh the pro uh actually Rel relat     
4:32     
to uh that we uh     
4:37     
actually we were discussing I got some an email that I've been sing to you with     
4:45     
actually uhing we're uh working     
4:51     
on actually what we we talked about last week uh we have     
4:57     
something uh if that would be very interesting uh that     
5:03     
we could maybe uh model or generate some models for uh as a case stud for The     
5:11     
Locomotion of silons during different Lal States especially L1     
5:16     
to4 uh and uh this is something that uh     
5:22     
from a developmental point of view would be really interesting uh so I'm trying     
5:29     
to see if it is possible to uh have different uh abstract layers of uh of     
5:37     
project which we have in world called c22 uh in that project uh we are for     
5:46     
something like four different layers for uh modeling uh lural networks of     
5:53     
silons which is uh the difference between each layer is usually uh     
6:00     
related to uh the amount of data we have     
6:05     
and especially the uh we can say the the dimension of the models we usually deal     
6:12     
with uh we from molecular and SAR point of view to     
6:18     
to the most abstract layers like Network layers we usually have different amount of data so we are trying to     
6:25     
c22 uh this project is trying to uh have different levels of complexity     
6:35     
uated model so I'm I was trying to see if we could uh do something like this     
6:44     
regarding the as well     
6:52     
so stage of to be possible to uh have an abstract model for for example um L1 L2     
7:00     
L3 and L4 and an adult one so uh     
7:06     
according to the paper we discussed last week and also one more paper that uh uh     
7:12     
I'm not sure if if you have been presented or if you have been reviewed that paper that's Padre uh mentioned     
7:20     
during our actually when we're talking about this topic uh Brad have you ever     
7:27     
covered the paper that I mentioned that was a great paper I guess there were     
7:33     
something like eight different states of the and every detail uh data that could be Poss     
7:41     
possibly included in that uh in the model I I was looking and I was     
7:46     
summarizing the the paper for our for the draft that we were talking about uh     
7:52     
have you ever covered that paper sessions I'm not sure which paper     
7:59     
is this refresh my memory uh yeah the paper that's uh sent     
8:05     
us last actually during the email that we were talking let me uh send one more     
8:12     
this paper that was a really great paper uh regarding the development of C oh yes     
8:19     
they are the development of it's a data set of developing with data     
8:27     
from I guess eight different laal Estates or eight different     
8:35     
point data yeah yeah yeah that's I think     
8:40     
that's the one I had mentioned last week but I couldn't remember the name of it so yeah we can go through that real     
8:47     
quick um today and I think that'd be good to see yeah yeah was a really great     
8:54     
paper and I was working on this paper I I actually summarized the paper for our     
8:59     
gra you're working on and also uh the other project that Mr Gordon mentioned     
9:06     
uh I've been working on uh actually the the challenge that uh pointed out some     
9:13     
weeks ago and I've been going through the challenge and that was a a great     
9:18     
experience and some great work we have been doing doing actually to be able to     
9:24     
do the imor construction uh there are some overlap I guess in the future share     
9:29     
between what you have done in the past uh     
9:35     
for for some models uh approachs so we can use some similar     
9:44     
approach uh during these uh different projects as well so I'm ready to discuss     
9:51     
any of them well that's great yeah thanks for the update Ved     
9:56     
yeah yeah I'm glad to see that uh the image classification processing     
10:02     
stuff is moving along too that's great uh yeah Susan about     
10:10     
[Music] you you're     
10:19     
muted oh yeah you're muted Susan can't hear     
10:25     
you things were anyway um my model didn't work so I um I found     
10:34     
this reference so I printed it out and it's a thesis okay mechanics and flow of     
10:40     
biological tissues at 2023 December so it's very recent it's got a lot of good     
10:48     
points and and nice references in it oh great yeah it's anyway yeah so your     
10:58     
thesis is uh they want you to come to a close on it or yeah um it's I have to do     
11:06     
a candidacy it has to be sort of related to my thesis but sort of a separate project oh okay so they want me to     
11:13     
finish and they to finish this they want me to finish my final model my final     
11:18     
model doesn't want to finish it it um console doesn't like it     
11:25     
when you're um I you know strings uh ropes that are holding thing     
11:33     
together holding things together when they when they go slack when they when     
11:39     
they're yeah it causes an error and if it was a cell     
11:45     
it doesn't care or it uses that for growth     
11:51     
or it it's not not relevant right to a     
11:56     
living cell and the super program just gives me it gives me what     
12:05     
was it six um void equations that was     
12:12     
it where I have some strings and I'm going Yep they're sagging it doesn't     
12:17     
like it just I'm so done with this program so sagging strings that's the     
12:26     
problem I think so it doesn't say it just says there's void equations it doesn't tell you why yeah dick says     
12:33     
slackness could be replaced by buckling due to compression I I yes I tried that     
12:39     
I made them into rods it still had six void     
12:45     
equations I added some more posts on the outside then it gave me five more void     
12:52     
equations with for a total of 11 void equations so I took the post out     
13:03     
okay well yeah well good luck trying to     
13:08     
fix it I don't know how to I don't have any because it's console I don't have any     
13:13     
device so no I want to use mat lab I just like yeah there a void equation it     
13:20     
gives me an error message and it says error number 5314 you copy that you paste it in     
13:27     
Google and it comes up with people's solutions to that era and what it is     
13:34     
and yeah there's no help desk with with console at least not the way they're     
13:40     
doing it at the University yeah yeah no one to     
13:46     
ask there no there's no local community of people using console or is it just in     
13:53     
here out at the farm this is my my room out here in my living room called     
13:59     
and family room and no um I don't know anybody else using console except the     
14:07     
people from Consul and you ask them and they say well you have to go through the     
14:12     
university because that's the agreement and you try to go through the     
14:17     
university and it takes a week for them to answer a question oh wow then you may     
14:24     
have Sol it or you may have given up and gone away depending yeah     
14:32     
so it's impossible I well that's one good thing about well-maintained open source is that it's     
14:40     
uh usually they have some sort of community around it although sometimes it doesn't make that much of a difference because uh depending what you     
14:47     
want to do so oh okay yeah there people have problems like this yes yeah but it     
14:54     
just slows everything down I mean oh I know yeah I'm I'm at least six months     
15:00     
slow with this so yeah so he had a comment in the slack     
15:06     
here or in the chat uh mahul said interesting analysis outcome in the paper above and that's this paper here     
15:14     
uh with age the brain becomes progressively more feedforward and discernably modular short and crisp     
15:20     
paper to read and then vahed gave a thumbs up so um yeah so that's great um did anyone     
15:28     
else have anything they want to mention before we start in the next     
15:37     
thing there is a related work in the progress to make data like these work available by the open room like     
15:44     
this yeah so this is actually uh let's see this is the openworm reader this     
15:51     
is yeah this is a spreadsheet data reader from c302 it's so one of the things in open     
15:58     
worm because it's open source and they're working on a lot of Open Source data sets and trying to get those uh     
16:06     
together is they have a number of tools for pulling pulling data out of things     
16:12     
like spreadsheets and so this is I guess the this I think puts it into something     
16:17     
like neuron I'm not sure what the details of this code are but basically     
16:23     
that's how this uh you know openworm has a number of tools people worked on like that over the years     
16:29     
so it should be interesting uh I don't know we don't get a lot of use out of them um but yeah people have made tools     
16:37     
like that be interesting to see you know what we could do with this uh with some     
16:42     
some of the stuff we want to do here can utilize some of these     
16:48     
tools okay I'm gonna go onto that paper then and so let me share my     
16:57     
screen here we go     
17:03     
um so this is uh an this is from nature Daniel whipy is the head author uh he     
17:11     
made the rounds a couple years ago presenting this paper in different places and he in fact joined our slack     
17:16     
for a while um the open room slack uh Meen is another uh scientist I think     
17:22     
she's at the University of Toronto she does a lot of stuff with this and uh Steve LaRon has talk to her about some     
17:29     
of the data that they're things that they're doing and so this is a interesting paper we've got a lot     
17:35     
of um authors on this uh the title is connectomes across development reveal     
17:42     
principles of brain maturation and this is um where they looked at they're     
17:47     
looking at the Developmental connecto and they're looking at uh the different     
17:52     
larel stages and they're extracting data about the synapses so if you're familiar     
17:59     
with uh cigan connectum or even if you're not you know you have the     
18:05     
connectum that we generally think of and most of those connectomes are based on     
18:12     
uh like Gap Junctions so the idea is that when you know they take micrographs of the of the worm and they look for     
18:19     
places where the cells connect and they can actually Mark those and then they've uh created a list of connections from     
18:26     
that uh the those are electrical connections so that's one form of     
18:32     
connectivity that you can have another form of course is chemical and that comes from the synaptic connections the     
18:39     
synaptic connections are a little tougher to to characterize they uh emerge and     
18:45     
disappear much uh you know at a much higher rate than say like the physical connections the physical connections are     
18:52     
generally fixed I mean you know you have like cells that come into contact and     
18:58     
you know once you get to sort of the I guess the L1 stage those are pretty much     
19:04     
in place but the uh synapses as you'll see in this paper they change some of them are     
19:11     
persistent but some of them change and some of them change in response to environment some of them change in     
19:18     
response to developmental stage and some of them persist uh from a very you know     
19:23     
across larel development so this is a what we might sort of chemical     
19:30     
connectivity uh and this is an interesting thing because people haven't really characterized this a lot so this     
19:36     
is um this is the paper here so the abstract reads this is what um um we     
19:44     
were just mentioning an animal's nervous system changes as its body grows from birth to adulthood and Its Behavior is     
19:51     
mature the form an extent of circuit remodeling across the connectome is unknown so that's what I was talking     
19:56     
about it's remodeling with respect to synapses uh so the circuits through model if you have synapses from cell a     
20:04     
to cell b if they uh have a synapse and usually the sometimes the synapses are     
20:10     
you know specific to a certain neurotransmitter sometimes they're more General but you know this is this is     
20:16     
what they're saying is all of this is unknown really in celegans um here we use serial section     
20:23     
electron microscopy to reconstruct the full brain from eight is genic seans     
20:29     
individuals it means that they have the same genetic background and you know that's it's from the same line uh across     
20:38     
postnatal stages to investigate how it changes with age so this is these these     
20:43     
uh you know these four laral stages L1 L2 L3 L4 then they just took samples     
20:50     
from each one and they're going to characterize the change across those     
20:56     
stages the overall geometry of the brain is preserved from birth to adulthood so     
21:01     
you know when it hatches right at the beginning of L1 that geometry of the brain is     
21:06     
preserved so those uh Gap Junction connections those electrical connections     
21:11     
are more or less preserved so this isn't changing too much there's you know there's a little bit of uh well I mean     
21:19     
there's no uh change in that aspect of it uh the the cells don't migrate for     
21:24     
example there there are things that are there's some morphogenesis postnatally     
21:29     
but that's usually not in the brain or in the in the connectone so the thing     
21:35     
that is changing however are these synaptic connections so that's what they're going to look at um and then so     
21:42     
the overall geometry of the brain is preserved but substantial changes in chemical synapse connectivity emerg on     
21:48     
this consistent scaffold so the synapses are the connections between cells you     
21:54     
have uh you know these chemical connections and they may you know uh     
22:01     
disappear or appear or remain constant throughout development uh comparing connect     
22:08     
connectomes between individuals reveal substantial differences in connectivity     
22:13     
that make each brain partly unique so this kind of chemical connectivity changes across     
22:19     
individuals um and so this is where this is why this is very interesting comparing connectomes across maturation     
22:26     
reveals consistent wiring changes between different neurons so even between two neurons we have wiring     
22:33     
changes uh throughout development with the chemical uh set of connections as     
22:39     
opposed to the electrical connections which don't usually see the we don't usually see these     
22:45     
changes uh these changes alter the strength of existing connections and create new connections so you know     
22:52     
sometimes the what the uh synapses do is they augment where they tune fine-tune     
23:00     
the electrical connections so if two two cells are said to be connected in the     
23:05     
connectone in say like the uh you know     
23:10     
in electric we'll call it an electrical connectone then there might also be synapses between those two cells but     
23:18     
those synapses then can tune that interaction or tune that communication between the     
23:23     
cells you can also have synapse only connections which connect two cells that     
23:29     
might not be connected in the connectone so we've been working from a lot of different uh electrical     
23:36     
connectomes where you know we have the list of connections and some of those     
23:41     
you know we don't we understand those connections either exist or don't exist but what this is doing is saying well     
23:48     
maybe those connections are more fine-tuned maybe you know we have different grades of uh strength of the     
23:55     
connection over development maybe you know that connection is reinforced by     
24:01     
having more synaptic connections or fewer synaptic connections or we might have new cells     
24:08     
connected and that's based much more on say the environmental     
24:13     
context so um Collective changes in the network alter information processing     
24:20     
during development the central decision-making circuitry is maintained whereas sensory motor pathways     
24:26     
substantially remodel so this is really interesting so in SE elegans we do have     
24:31     
a decision-making circuitry and it's really uh you know involves like say go     
24:37     
you know trying to find food or trying to find mates or you know navigating around their environment and so those     
24:44     
are all basically maintained what changes a lot is and you might expect this from what I just told you is that     
24:51     
the sensoring motor pathways remodel quite a bit so the pathways generating movement are going a remodel the pathway     
24:59     
is generating sensory input uh like um you know the sense of     
25:05     
touch those are going to remodel as well and of course you would expect that because in development we have a number     
25:12     
of different uh needs for this so for example there I talked about last week     
25:17     
the dower stage which goes from L2 to L4 and it's this sort of um you know     
25:24     
alternative adaptive phenotype that some were will uh     
25:30     
enter uh and so they have this they have these uh substantial adaptations in     
25:37     
terms of their sensory Pathways and of course their motor pathways because they're lergo     
25:42     
quiescent uh so they have to do make a lot of changes with respect to that um     
25:49     
with age the brain becomes progressively more feedforward and discernably modular as I mentioned before that just means     
25:55     
that you don't have a lot of feedback uh through these synaptic connections and     
26:00     
you get these uh specializations of function thus developmental conomics     
26:05     
reveals principles in underly brain maturation so that's uh you know they     
26:11     
talk about a lot of these things here uh and so this has a data set associated     
26:16     
with it so these are um some of the data     
26:22     
that we have available uh so uh all electron microscopy images     
26:28     
and volumetric reconstructions are available at this site bb.org     
26:33     
project and then connectivity matrices for all data sets are available at nemato to.org and as supplementary     
26:40     
tables so they have supplementary tables and here you can download I've actually worked with these data so I've worked     
26:46     
with the supplementary tables so let's look at the data here so this this uh     
26:53     
this is one of the data sets here this is uh with Fleet 2020 eight     
26:59     
highresolution electron microscopy volumes of celan's brains at different stages of development spanning from     
27:06     
birth to adulthood so this is uh these are the data so this     
27:12     
shows kind of where they're getting their data so they actually have here available uh four volumes for L1 one     
27:20     
volume for L2 one volume for L3 and then two for the adult so you can see these     
27:26     
little Circ that's the connectum volume um these data can be browsed at     
27:32     
Neman no.org synaps metadata and segmentation labels are available here so you know if you     
27:39     
want to go in you can find these um so yeah this is basically the     
27:45     
these are the instructions to do this uh this is in a you can do this in a collab notebook or uh on your own computer you     
27:54     
can basically do a pip install for this it's so it allows you to browse the data     
28:00     
um and so this is all got they they did all this with a wild type hermaphroditic     
28:05     
celan's brain so this is the standard uh wild type uh brain that you might expect     
28:12     
uh and then they just did the different stages of development they reared these in the same environments they don't have     
28:17     
a lot of environmental variation and then you know they so the brain consists of 162 of the total 218 neurons at Birth     
28:27     
so there's some more neurons that appear in the nervous system but this is something that you get like in post     
28:35     
embrionic uh morphogenesis but basically the brain itself is is all intact at     
28:42     
Birth uh the you know there are other areas uh where you get neurons like in     
28:48     
the periphery uh and the 180 of the total 300 neurons in adulthood so this     
28:54     
is basically a subset of those neurons as well as 32 muscles at all stages so     
29:00     
the brain their brain the way they segmented out they have most of everything they have muscles they have     
29:06     
neurons uh each cell has been reconstructed identified based in its unique neurite morphology and position     
29:12     
and had synapses annotated so this is of course they're looking at the synapses so they have the synapses     
29:19     
annotated uh so they have data set one this has some information about it data     
29:25     
set two so they how many data sets that they have eight so and then they give the position of these data sets sort of     
29:32     
where the volume is um across these yeah this is cool uh this is nice     
29:39     
to have um that so that's what's available there on Boss     
29:44     
TV and then uh there's also neem to.org or Neeman no.org I'm     
29:51     
sorry and I'm not familiar with this resource but okay well let's see if you     
29:58     
AI y so this actually gives you um in network information so this actually has     
30:05     
information about the synapses and GAP Junctions so Gap Junctions are the electrical connections all right you can     
30:12     
see by the little icon and those are here so AWB and aiy have a gap Junction     
30:19     
connection an electrical connection ASG and aiy also B A and aiy have a uh an electrical     
30:28     
connection but they also have a chemical connection going in the direction of aiy to B A and then you know you have ASC     
30:36     
which has uh chemical synapse bidirectional chemical synapses with     
30:41     
also having an electrical connection now you can also see the value added here because you have a     
30:49     
number of different uh chemical syapse only connections afd to aiy AWC to aiy B     
30:57     
directional between a w and aiy and a couple other relationships so that's really     
31:03     
interesting information so we can look up any neuron and we know the neurons like the neurons are well characterized     
31:09     
they have a nomenclature so we can actually look at those connections by searching here that's another good     
31:16     
reference um and then of course this is all scripts and cod and files used to     
31:22     
generate all figures are available here this is a GitHub repository say     
31:28     
Daniel's uh get up repository this is for nature 2021 and it has the it doesn't have a     
31:35     
read me in it but or you know it has like the data figures and tables so data     
31:42     
here this is just stuff that's been exported to Neman node so this this should give you that     
31:48     
same information all right so um the last     
31:58     
yeah in this case if you open the the IP you can you can see all the images and     
32:04     
the data that they us the that you were actually uh you uh     
32:12     
describing reopen it you can uh in the homepage of the G there is a beautiful     
32:19     
IB file that uh all these images and the     
32:25     
data uh yeah this yeah okay so that yeah here here the     
32:31     
general the general that's oh the The Notebook yeah yeah that's a great okay     
32:39     
resource for for showing all data are available and all the     
32:46     
figures for this oh that's great yeah so this will give you every the volumetric models so this is a yeah this is the     
32:54     
nerve ring volumetric model here and it just shows everything and then connecto     
33:00     
networks here which are just you know nodes and connections nodes and arcs and     
33:06     
you know you can plot them all out in the uh Jupiter notebook or the guess     
33:11     
collab notebook um yeah it looks good this looks good so you can do experiments in     
33:17     
here too this is great all right um see we had some     
33:25     
things in the chat here uh mle asked does chemical connectivity functional     
33:31     
connectivity and brain bold signal and physical connectivity as s in the brain so yeah I guess you could say that     
33:39     
like um well functional connectivity and bold is more about like correlations     
33:46     
between voxal uh and then or I guess like the     
33:53     
you know you could uh get like the anatomy of a brain Network and then     
33:59     
effective connectivity is a little bit different but basically yeah it's it's not quite the same thing because in with     
34:07     
the Bold signal they're not measuring uh synaptic connections versus like uh     
34:13     
electrical connections but it's it's um in terms of just kind of the     
34:19     
network uh abstraction you know that's that's it's kind of similar hard to     
34:25     
really say but yeah as a men and as an analogy since you mentioned that chemical connectivity     
34:31     
changes like FC yeah I mean there yeah they going to be a lot more changes in     
34:36     
the chemical connections so yeah I guess it could be a useful um     
34:43     
analogy so yeah then Susan asked the following references the thesis I was     
34:49     
talking about yeah as Hernandez yeah you sent this in an email Susan so I have it     
34:55     
um I'm going to talk about that next but uh you know we'll uh I'm not going to     
35:00     
talk about the the thesis but we'll we'll talk about some papers you sent that's okay I was just it's just a a     
35:08     
reference for references like that there's some really good references in     
35:14     
in the thesis yeah that's all okay yeah yeah so yeah um yeah so that that's I     
35:22     
think that's enough on the uh thank you for bringing that up for heed the whip fet paper it was a very good thing to     
35:28     
pull up um like I said this is really interesting     
35:33     
work um and there's a lot here that probably could be useful to     
35:39     
understanding movement in uh larvel development you know kind of mining the data and saying you know what kinds of     
35:46     
questions do we want to ask about it um especially with some of the other papers     
35:51     
that we have like you know we've got a number of papers on the motor circuit     
35:57     
um you know neoen and Eduardo wio they've done a number of things on that     
36:04     
just looking at the computational structure of that and sort of what's you know what's going on with the function     
36:11     
so there might be some interesting questions there and then of course you know we can because we know the cells     
36:17     
the identity of the cells we can get molecular data as well and I I I didn't     
36:23     
pull that up this time but I mean it it would have to be something where we' have a specific question to ask because     
36:29     
the molecular data is kind of like you have to know kind of What gene you're looking for or set of genes you're     
36:35     
looking for okay uh so what's transition over to     
36:43     
this um the the Susan what Susan was uh what's she sent and of course she's     
36:50     
interested in a lot of the stuff on tension in cells and so she's got she     
36:56     
sent me two paper she sent me that uh thesis and it's really long but it has a     
37:01     
lot of good references in it but this is the first paper that she sent me that I really thought it was really interesting     
37:08     
so this is from current biology this is growth in tension and explosive fruit     
37:13     
it's a very provocative title but basically it's about uh fruit in plants     
37:20     
and it's the growth and tension in those uh structures and then the explosion     
37:27     
so you know I think we've talked about this before where things can like     
37:33     
explode they they've use this and it's not really a metaphor because they actually do explode but like what causes     
37:39     
explosions and other types of nonlinear effects in tissues it's really     
37:45     
interesting stuff so this is the graphical abstract here this is a plant and the stem you know it's growing in     
37:51     
there these fruit fruiting bodies here uh so 1 2 3 4     
37:57     
and so this is where they're exploding they're releasing seeds and then this is     
38:03     
uh so these are the steps towards explosion you have elongation which is     
38:08     
this step here one so the uh fting body is elongating then two you have widening     
38:15     
so the fting body widens so it elongates and then it widens and then three is where there's     
38:22     
tension so there's tension within the fting body and then for is the explosion     
38:28     
where it opens up the seeds come out and it rips apart so if you look at this uh     
38:34     
Legend here for stress maximum stress is red the minimum stress is blue so     
38:39     
basically you have blue and the elongation step with these uh like these     
38:45     
lines of Maximum stress and then widening is where the whole uh body     
38:53     
widens out but it you know it still has minimum stress except for these uh lines     
38:59     
here and then in three you have tension so you have tension which is where there's tension building in the     
39:06     
structure and then you know maximum in the middle here maybe minimum on the     
39:11     
sides in moderate amounts of stress at the edges and then explosion where it releases that that stress and it opens     
39:19     
up and then you see there's minimum stress again so basically that's the what they're doing this is these are     
39:26     
cross patterns of cellulose microfi this is what's going on with the these individual cells so you have cell growth     
39:34     
and then elastic contraction um so then um okay so in     
39:39     
brief is how growth a stress relaxation process which is what they call growth     
39:46     
produces tension in exploding seed pods and to them it's puzzling I guess is to     
39:52     
most people mosca at all which is the paper that they're referencing so a lot of these papers will be like you know a     
39:58     
lot of these type of papers in current biology where they they have papers where they introduce other     
40:04     
papers uh mosca at all find that a specific pattern of cell expansion     
40:09     
regulated by microt tual dependent cellulous deposition leads to contractile tension so as the cellulose     
40:16     
is being laid down it in increases the tension on or contractile tension on     
40:22     
this tissue growth also has an active role in increasing tension on cell fibers and a cross lamet cell wall and     
40:30     
so the highlights of this are that growth generates contractility the pulling force in the fruit exocarp     
40:36     
switch in microt tual orientation underlies change in cellular growth patterns cross pattern of cellulous     
40:43     
microf fibros enhances contraction of growing cells and multi-layer growth     
40:48     
framework used to model cross laml cell walls so let's see a comment here okay     
40:56     
dick has a comment survey of biological explosions right uh G uh dick Gordon     
41:03     
wrote uh paper 2018 explosive biopulsar organisms this is I remember this paper     
41:11     
uh this is where I think you list like the different explanations yeah     
41:17     
talk yeah that's that's great um would you mind or would you mind I don't know remember     
41:24     
if you had I think you gave the T long time ago but um I don't know if you'd want to reive the talk or you at least     
41:31     
talked about it a while back so yeah this is this is this is     
41:38     
good um yeah so there's a lot of interesting stuff on     
41:44     
explosions in biology so this is the paper here     
41:50     
mosca uh growth intention and explosive fruit they talk they have this common     
41:57     
exploding seed pods of the common weed uh cardamine or suda have the remarkable     
42:03     
ability to launch seeds far from the plants so that's why they have to do this explosion the energy for this     
42:08     
explosion comes from tension that builds up in Fruit Valves and I know that dick in in the stuff that he was talking     
42:14     
about there in that comment you know he's interested in this in diatoms and datom propulsion you know can be     
42:20     
explained as kind of like an explosion so there are different way reasons you might have an explosion in the cell or     
42:27     
in some cellular uh you know multicellular Colony or something like     
42:33     
that where you have this you know you can have this uh     
42:38     
nonlinear uh transfer of energy and that's that's what an explosion is and     
42:44     
so basically you know it's a means for this plant to uh disperse its     
42:50     
seeds and so they have there's this uh very you know elaborate uh morphogenetic     
42:57     
process that manages this sort of explosion uh by explicitly defining this     
43:04     
cell wall is a multi-layered structure on our model we discovered that a cross lamolet pattern of cellulous microf     
43:10     
fibral further enhances the development tension in growing cells therefore the interplay of cell wall properties with     
43:17     
triger driven growth enables the fruit exitar to generate sufficient tension to     
43:23     
power explosive seed dispersal that's an interesting paper     
43:28     
um then this other paper that Susan uh sent me was uh a little bit     
43:35     
different it's not about explosions it's about this uh so the title is tension in     
43:40     
the ranks Cooperative cell contractions driven Force dependent collagen assembly     
43:45     
in human fiber blast culture so this is where we have cell contractions that are     
43:52     
coordinated across cells and it d drives this for stending collagen assembly so     
43:59     
again we have a graphical abstract we have this uh extracellular Matrix     
44:05     
structure formation bellular retrograde poles so this uh basically you have     
44:12     
bunch of cells and then generating this extracellular Matrix this is where the cells sort of reside when they're moving     
44:19     
around there's a extracellular matrix that is you know uh provides sort of a     
44:25     
means for them to move against and to interact with and so this is basically     
44:31     
showing this process of this ECM structure by these so retrograde po so     
44:37     
what they're doing these cells are coming together they're releasing these extracellular Matrix precursors and     
44:44     
there's pull creating mechanical strain so there's this Force environment already as the ECM is being formed and     
44:52     
then the membrane stretches and it organizes the the bound ECM precursors     
44:57     
so there's this collagen and fibronectin which result from this pushing and     
45:02     
pulling uh or at least this pulling that's creating mechanical strain it's     
45:08     
creating these fibers that allow for the thing to these ECM uh precursors to form     
45:15     
so they align concentrate and polymerize across lines of force so now you have this ECM structure that's this long     
45:23     
fiber that's kind of joined to these two cells it's formed of collagen and fiberon and     
45:28     
this is coming you know from the uh from the cells and the cells are creating     
45:34     
Force to generate these structures so you can see that one of these structures you know some of these structures are     
45:41     
identified in this uh in this microscopy image and a close-up image you can see     
45:47     
that it's stained for fiberon and collagen and that's that corresponds to this diagram     
45:54     
here so the highlights of this paper uh the kinematics of fiber blast motion     
46:00     
were Quantified five unique classes of retrograde poles which is what this processes up here by fiber blasts were     
46:08     
identified so they actually have different types of poles that exist in cell culture those resulted in formation     
46:15     
of fibral or fi fibronectin and collagen in The extracellular Matrix and a new     
46:21     
model for initial durable structure formation in animals is proposed so again these are just structures that you     
46:27     
know exist outside the cells and the cell Matrix and cells when they're coming together in a culture or in     
46:33     
tissues they're forming these all the time because they need them uh for various reasons and so they have to be     
46:40     
strong and durable but you know they don't you know you can't just secrete stuff and let it self organize out there     
46:47     
in the in the world the cells need to actively pull and shape this these     
46:53     
structures together so this is cool this is another uh so okay uh the summary reads     
47:02     
uh currently there are no mechanistic models that fully explain the initial synthesis and organization of durable     
47:09     
animal structure what that means is like how do you get tissues to be the structure that they are you can't just     
47:15     
have a bag of cells you need some structure it's almost like a gelatin you know you need something to embed the     
47:21     
cells in um as a result our understanding of extracellular Matrix development the pathologies remain     
47:28     
limited here we identify and characterize cell generated mechanical strains at direct the Assembly of the     
47:35     
ECM cell kinematics comprise Cooperative retrograde poles which we saw that     
47:41     
organize and precipitate biopolymer structure along lines of tension high     
47:46     
resolution Optical microscopy revealed five unique classes of retrograde poles that resulted in the production of     
47:53     
filaments so uh focal Imaging confirm that retrograde poles can directly cause     
47:59     
the formation of fibran filaments that then colocalize with collagen Aggregates     
48:05     
exported from the cell producing persistent elongated structures aligned with the direction of the tension so     
48:12     
these structures are aligned with the tension between the cells as they're pulling apart these findings suggest a     
48:19     
new model for initial durable structure formation in animals and have important     
48:24     
implications for the development of extracellular Matrix so yeah that's another good     
48:32     
paper so thank you for that Susan uh we have another couple comments     
48:38     
here uh let's see I don't know how to pronounce this word     
48:44     
uh disco basist and AIG okr monus are preloaded or the LG okay LG o Cronus     
48:52     
they're preloaded yeah uh that's interesting contractions in Axel a cells and     
48:59     
contraction waves are massive 10 times the size of the I guess uh yeah and then nonlinear     
49:07     
explosive contraction I guess you could I guess you could have     
49:12     
that um the ECM or basement membrane um actually guides um stem     
49:21     
cells to turn into whatever cell type they're supposed to turn into yeah and working with the um P     
49:31     
secrity I just got a paper and they had um P secrity model and it     
49:37     
changed um the way it mechanically moved     
49:42     
according to how it was attached it was a produce that J curve     
49:48     
for you you change um the stress strain from one value to another     
49:57     
so um well T sties tend to do that but um     
50:06     
they were trying to emulate a a cell a single cell     
50:12     
yeah but it it makes a big difference the substrate that a cell is attached     
50:18     
to and how it is attached so um that's     
50:24     
why that's why this is important it's showing that um contraction and tension     
50:30     
are important in creating the basement membrane or the     
50:35     
ECM yeah and then that in turn affects the     
50:42     
cells yeah yeah definitely well that's good that's the     
50:49     
my why I was so interested in in that paper showing ECM develop     
50:57     
it yeah that's     
51:02     
okay uh so yeah uh then I have one paper that I added to this from some of the     
51:10     
things uh this is actually uh interesting this is something that I ran     
51:15     
across in a seminar so there's this is a paper called curvature and do cell     
51:21     
rearrangement and biological tissues so this isn't forces necessarily but this is sort of that topology of the     
51:28     
cell and so this is talking about curved surfaces and how that plays a role in uh     
51:36     
in morphogenesis so this is from the Sounders lab which is where they're working on these kind of     
51:43     
questions uh they gave a talk in uh one a seminar that I attended and they that     
51:49     
was really interesting stuff so they're doing a lot of stuff with uh sort of     
51:55     
cell physics cellular physics and things like that so if you go to the Publications uh they have a lot of stuff     
52:02     
on uh different positioning mechanics and symmetry breaking and     
52:10     
uh uh some other you know molecular signaling stuff it's really diverse work     
52:16     
but this work here is on this phenomena of curvature and do c     
52:25     
ments so the abstract of this paper reads on a curved surface epithelial     
52:31     
cells can adapt to geometric constraints by tilting and by exchanging their neighbors from apical to Basil sides     
52:39     
known as apical basil T1 which is AB to T1 transition so this is actually uh you     
52:46     
know this is something that they're naming uh I think it's in mammals I'm     
52:51     
not really sure what the mo model is a uh but anyways the relationship between     
52:57     
cell tilt abt1 Transitions and tissue curvature still acts a unified     
53:04     
understanding so basically you have epithelial cells you have this curved surface they're adapting to the     
53:10     
geometric constraints of that curved surface by tilting and exchanging their neighbors from basic apical to Basil     
53:17     
sides and so that's what this transition is and all those Dynamics uh and so we don't really     
53:24     
understand why this works or how it works here we propose a general framework for cell packing and curved     
53:31     
environments and explain the formation of abt1 transitions under different     
53:36     
conditions we find that Steve curvature gradients can lead to cell tilting and     
53:42     
induce abt1 transitions so this depending on the curvature gradient that     
53:47     
you have you have you can have increased cell tilting or limited cell tilting and     
53:53     
it can induce these trans transitions conversely large curvature and isotropy can drive abt1 transitions     
54:01     
by hydrostatic pressure so you can actually have this sort of curvature if the curvature is large enough you can     
54:08     
have hydrostatic pressure playing a role in some of these transitions as well the two mechanisms compete to     
54:15     
determine the impact of tissue geometry and mechanics and optimize cell Arrangements in     
54:21     
3D so this is uh they kind of talk about this uh so the ex as the external     
54:27     
surface and barriers in many organs epithelial tissues have to mechanically adapt to their environment and so you     
54:34     
know if we look at cell shape in two dimensions and three dimensions it reveals insights into how cells pack and     
54:41     
undergo rearrangement during epithelial tissue formation so there's a lot of packing Dynamics and rearrangements     
54:49     
going on and we talked about some of these epithelial sheets and what they looked like a couple weeks ago but you     
54:55     
know that that was just kind of a straight line sort of set of examples if we add curvature then we have another     
55:01     
set of examples to work for so this is where you know we     
55:07     
have uh these cellular Dynamic processes like Division and apotosis and RAR range     
55:13     
cell neighbors these are what they call T1 transitions or the exchange of neighbors without altering the cell     
55:19     
number so you can have these different types of um you know exchanges without     
55:25     
having more cells packed into the same loc into the same volume uh T1 transitions are important     
55:32     
IMM mediating planner tissue Dynamics for example oriented T1 transitions can     
55:38     
lead to tissue elongation or flow and the energetic barriers for t-1 transitions to occur can dictate tissue     
55:45     
fluidity solidity so again it can determine like how loose or packed the     
55:52     
tissue is so there are a lot of things here a lot of interesting work in this paper um I don't know I don't want to     
56:00     
really go through it that deeply but uh I don't know in light of the other two papers I think it's     
56:08     
interesting let's see okay so yeah have analogous curvature literature for cell     
56:18     
membranes okay yeah so um that's     
56:23     
good uh yeah I actually did want to mention one more thing before we go uh     
56:29     
and this is something that Morgan kind of brought my attention to but something it came in my inbox this morning     
56:35     
too uh this is the aife newsletter this is something that the um the     
56:42     
professional Society for artificial life they put this out on a regular basis and they always have some really interesting     
56:49     
stuff in here uh one thing I did want to talk about was this uh Point here um so     
56:56     
this is something reflecting back on artificial life but way back like 25     
57:01     
years ago so we've talked about like open questions and artificial life and things like that and you know it's it's     
57:09     
an area where people have been doing a lot of work simulating life simulating     
57:14     
biology but there are these open questions that sort of you know the field started as sort of a set of broad     
57:20     
open questions and they really haven't really been answered yet so this little     
57:26     
piece here uh reads what value does artificial life with its decades Rich     
57:32     
history of research diverse range of methods and everg growing focus and     
57:37     
interest bring to the scientific community at large let me bump this     
57:43     
up okay so this is kind of what we're you know what we've always kind of ask     
57:49     
about our Fields uh what how does it Advance our knowledge should we think     
57:55     
about artificial wife as its own discipline that tries to identify and understand new problems or give us new     
58:01     
ways of thinking uh do we instead just see the methods that we use as a means of inquiry to existing problems or     
58:08     
perhaps is artificial life just an excuse to be creative and wacky all in the name of scientific advancement so     
58:14     
there is a lot of stuff that's kind of like well this looks cool let's write it up but it doesn't necessarily answer any     
58:20     
biological questions so I mean that that artificial life is had that problem I     
58:26     
don't know if it's a problem but that's that's the way they've kind of approached it sometimes so you know this     
58:32     
this problem doesn't isn't something that's just happening because the field is you know uh because people can submit     
58:39     
papers and uh it's it's something that people really kind of wondered about from the start so there is no there are     
58:46     
no easy answers to this question of course this is why eal 99 which is the     
58:51     
conference in 1999 this was European conference in artificial life a debate     
58:57     
was held with some of the Field's most prominent researchers over these very questions so aif started at the Santa Fe     
59:04     
Institute in about 1987 or at least the first Conference was held there and they     
59:10     
had a bunch of like you know interesting topics kind of right from the start and     
59:15     
you know their focus was sort of on the origins of Life sort of simulating Life     
59:20     
simulating Evolution and it kind of went from there but you know by the time 1999 rolled around you know     
59:28     
people wanted to take a reality check and maybe think about you know what what     
59:34     
are what are the where is our where are we going with this and so um this is a     
59:39     
paper uh by Jason Noble Seth Bullock and Ezekiel D poo and they published a     
59:46     
report on this debate this took place 25 years ago at eal 1999 and then still a     
59:53     
relevant conversation today as it was then so this is a three-page paper     
59:58     
three-page report and this is in the journal     
1:00:04     
artificial life from Spring of 2000 uh artificial life discipliner method report on a debate held to ecel     
1:00:12     
99 and so you know this is one of the things they publish in artificial wife     
1:00:17     
they publish these um sort of reports of different events at the conferences     
1:00:22     
because the conferences are a very important part of that community so uh basically they to start     
1:00:29     
with the question how can artificial life Advance scientific understanding is artificial life scene     
1:00:35     
as a new discipline or is a collection of Novel computational methods that can be applied to Old problems and given     
1:00:43     
that the products of artificial life research R from range from abstract existence proofs to working robots to     
1:00:49     
detailed simulation models are there standards of quality or usefulness that can be applied across the whole field so     
1:00:56     
this reminds me kind of theorm foundation where we're doing like you know we do stuff with robots we do stuff     
1:01:03     
with computational modeling with data and then you know simulation models so     
1:01:09     
there's this very wide range of methods uh so they talked about this uh     
1:01:15     
we started by sketching a Contin of approaches to artificial life as a science at one extreme there are     
1:01:21     
researchers who use techniques such as genetic algorithms and animat style simulations an animat     
1:01:28     
is a sort of an an an analogy of an organism so it's not an animal it's an     
1:01:34     
animat and it might be some like model of an organism could be very simple or it could be more     
1:01:39     
complex so these are techniques that people used back then and they still do today but you know that's one way you     
1:01:46     
can approach problems is by simulating the biology in different     
1:01:52     
ways typically the problems come from from within biology the work of katano and colleagues on morphogenesis and     
1:01:59     
dropa is one example we see the work as exemplifying the idea of Al as a method     
1:02:05     
or as a collection of methods that could at least in theory be put to use by investigators in many different     
1:02:11     
fields okay so that's one extreme at The Other Extreme is the view that artificial life opens up a whole new way     
1:02:18     
of thinking that is it's a discipline in itself an example of this is Ray's work     
1:02:23     
on Tira which is a an artificial life platform I don't know if it's still supported but um that Ry and some other     
1:02:32     
commentators have taken to raise fundamental issues about what it means to call a system     
1:02:37     
alive if the existence of the Continuum is granted two questions are raised     
1:02:43     
first of all and so this Continuum is from like uh you know sort of these     
1:02:49     
techniques to look at existing problems and the other end of the Continuum are these methods     
1:02:54     
uh or or having a field in and of itself answering questions within that field so     
1:03:01     
basically it's either reped biology or it's its own thing uh two questions are raised first     
1:03:08     
of all uh are all possible uh are all possible positions along at tenable so     
1:03:15     
is it a true Continuum or is it just kind of two approaches to in you know to     
1:03:21     
a problem the skeptic might ask whether computers simulations of the kind developed by a Al researchers ever add     
1:03:28     
anything to existing formal methods and disciplines like biology so do we are we     
1:03:33     
adding anything to biology by simulating it and you know people have different opinions about that I think a lot of     
1:03:41     
biologists uh biologists aren't necessarily always on board with this so if you present this to like uh you know     
1:03:49     
biology group they may or may not think it's useful uh definitely like to other     
1:03:55     
groups like to bioengineers or to computer scientists they love this stuff     
1:04:01     
but maybe not so much uh for you know depending on what area of biology they're in as well it might be very     
1:04:09     
useful at the opposite end of the spectrum one might be cynical about the possibility of objectively studying life     
1:04:15     
as it could be okay so you know maybe we don't want to know uh about life as it could be or     
1:04:22     
maybe it's too speculative to say stuff like that but in you know artificial life we can answer a lot of questions     
1:04:28     
about Evolution about alternate forms of organisms about things that don't exist     
1:04:35     
in the biological World um and so this is important in the era of     
1:04:40     
bioengineering where we can create different types of uh mutant organism or     
1:04:45     
you know we can uh engineer genomes to do certain things we would like to know     
1:04:51     
what those things look like before we design them you know biological     
1:04:56     
instantiation or even what you know life might have looked like a billion you     
1:05:01     
know a billion years ago which we don't really have fossil remains for or fossil remains are uh tenuous at best so having     
1:05:09     
those kind of models are useful um and you know I could mention that you     
1:05:15     
know in openworm we try to simulate seans um you know seans is pretty well     
1:05:22     
characterized oh could simulate behaviors that you might not see in the lab because you just simply don't have     
1:05:28     
the methods in the lab to get get at some of these behavioral modes so uh     
1:05:34     
those are all things uh the second question concerns quality how can we distinguish good work from Bad the two     
1:05:41     
questions are not independent if one easl research is some kind of thought experiment one's quality Criterion could     
1:05:47     
well differ from those of someone who is interested in more or less precise models of real world systems     
1:05:55     
so you know some people present thought experiments and thought experiments are useful in the sense that they pose     
1:06:01     
problems better they give us a sharper sort of refinement of a problem or they     
1:06:07     
give us maybe an Avenue to go down later uh but some people like precise models     
1:06:12     
they like sort of hyper realistic models they like you know everything to be defined and in some systems you can do     
1:06:19     
that very well like seans in other systems you can't and so this is the     
1:06:24     
problem that we've had sometimes questions are bigger than like anyone um     
1:06:29     
especially like theoretical questions about say like life or you know cross     
1:06:35     
species comparisons where you can't do these kind of precise simulations so this is the tension in     
1:06:42     
this field so that's all I'll talk about for that I thought it was an interesting set of issues that were     
1:06:48     
raised and you know even though that debate happened in 1999 it's still relevant today     
1:06:58     
the uh actually I was going to discuss one more paper I was uh actually deeping     
1:07:06     
into uh during the last p uh there's one     
1:07:12     
gr a gr paper what was the paper about okay uh paper let me     
1:07:22     
uh paper is something uh related to what we are talking about as we said we are     
1:07:28     
going to uh consider both the molecular or cellular uh aspects of the     
1:07:35     
development of cagos for a case study we are going to deal with Locomotion uh and also the structural     
1:07:43     
properties of the developments so uh actually most of the papers and uh     
1:07:50     
the work so far uh I've been talking about the structural properties of the development     
1:07:56     
of cegon for example different wirings and how different cells and neurons are     
1:08:02     
uh related uh to different lval states uh and uh and if you see my let me share     
1:08:12     
this window again can you see this window is it     
1:08:18     
okay I'm not seeing anything oh not yet wow that's true what this is happing     
1:08:25     
but uh regarding to what you what you are representing uh on the main paper we     
1:08:32     
were talking about uh during different LEL stage we have in the figure three     
1:08:38     
three part C you can see that we have from L1 to the adult one we have uh     
1:08:45     
maybe five different categories of cells like or behaviors like you can say what     
1:08:51     
are outputs body movements and and uh and also uh the inter neurons are uh are     
1:08:59     
three categories that or three modules that are uh during L1 to late L1 uh are     
1:09:08     
actually uh being uh considered but when we go through the L tree and adult uh     
1:09:17     
Stace we can see that two or three more structural modules are being added uh to     
1:09:24     
the uh to what we can say from an engine point of view different dimensions of     
1:09:30     
our model system but uh there are only structural properties from molecular     
1:09:38     
cell we also have some uh new we might have some uh new uh     
1:09:47     
features or uh added to the model so I'm trying to consider uh those features as     
1:09:53     
well the paper that I was going to uh to uh we mention uh is a model of model of     
1:10:02     
a wholesale uh and also network of wholesale we can say at least two     
1:10:09     
neurons that be or two cells could be connected to form a network so from that     
1:10:15     
point of view this could be the least possible uh consideration for a     
1:10:22     
developmental uh modeling we can say so I'm both I was also working on this     
1:10:30     
aspect and to be able to uh consider when when we are trying to model uh the     
1:10:37     
structural uh development uh we could also actually as a question could be     
1:10:43     
also consider the molecular and cellular aspects as well because the data is usually usually lack data for such uh     
1:10:52     
studies so I'm trying to to add those features as well and see if we could uh     
1:10:58     
work on this as well yeah hello     
1:11:05     
Hussein uh yeah so yeah it's uh yeah that sounds good I was looking actually     
1:11:10     
at the uh figure three of the paper and yeah so basically see if I can share my     
1:11:16     
screen here um so this is what uh he was talking     
1:11:24     
about you have this graph where you have the different developmental stages than     
1:11:30     
the adult then you have cells per module so it's the counting up the cells in each module and you have these modules     
1:11:37     
listed here and basically you get new modules emerge as you like get through     
1:11:43     
development so in the L1 worm you have three modules and then the L2 you have I guess     
1:11:51     
it starts to become four modules and L1 and L2 we have four modules and then five and L3 and then that persists into     
1:12:01     
adulthood so that's and then this all fits into sort of this network of     
1:12:06     
sensory motor inter neurons and then modulatory neurons so you have this network of the four types of neurons or     
1:12:13     
the four functions of neurons um in both feed forward and feedback so the other     
1:12:19     
thing they mentioned in the paper is that these feedback mechanisms kind of shut down uh so you you you know the     
1:12:26     
feedback mechanisms are used sort of to maybe you know as a supervisory mechanism until like training wheels     
1:12:33     
until you get some of these other modules in place and then you can have a feedforward network that's more uh     
1:12:40     
adultlike but also has more modules or more functional subdivisions and so they show the     
1:12:47     
proportion of synapses here so you can see that you have feedback decreasing the decrease isn't that much     
1:12:54     
so I mean you know it's not like there's no feedback in the adult worm it's just less and then you have uh this feed     
1:13:02     
forward that goes up so the number of feed forward synapses goes up so it's     
1:13:07     
definitely consistent with this graph     
1:13:13     
here so yeah if you could send the like the citation for that paper that you     
1:13:20     
were just talking about that would be good um and it would be uh you know that might     
1:13:26     
be something to follow up on uh definitely you know we can do modeling on this stuff uh we just have to figure     
1:13:32     
out you know how uh to put the data together how what makes sense to put it     
1:13:38     
together I the paper the second place I was talking about is not related to     
1:13:45     
developmental uh modeling as we were talking about what we are actually interested in is usually uh on this is     
1:13:54     
how to how we could uh uh look at the war     
1:14:00     
from during different laral stays and how different compartments are going to     
1:14:07     
be added to the model uh the work I'm interested in and related to my previous     
1:14:12     
work is that if molecular and cellular mechanisms are     
1:14:18     
also uh uh I I add links to the chat to     
1:14:24     
the paper like this this is not actually this paper is not going to be uh part of     
1:14:30     
the developmental modeling but some similar work to this is going to be uh     
1:14:36     
considered I'm saying that if we are trying to see a behavior from molecular     
1:14:42     
to structural compartments uh some some work like this is going also to be     
1:14:49     
considered and uh different uh molecular and cellular mechanisms are also going     
1:14:56     
to be considered for such a study in addition to a structural uh properties     
1:15:03     
of of the model yeah so this is the paper biophysical modeling of Sean     
1:15:11     
neurons and so what you're saying is that there's a they have a compartmentalization strategy for     
1:15:21     
this okay yeah this looks good sorry I guess     
1:15:26     
uh I'm I'm not having your voice cly list oh     
1:15:32     
my okay well yeah so yeah I just said that this looks     
1:15:37     
good and this will be good addition to this kind of work so yeah I mean you know I don't think people have really     
1:15:44     
mastered the methodology here so and anything you can bring to it would be     
1:15:52     
good okay well thank you yeah thank you Ved uh so anyone else have anything they     
1:16:00     
need to get off their chest before we go     
1:16:11     
comments oh I'm good okay all right so well thank you for     
1:16:17     
meeting uh if you have any questions please follow up in the slack or email or whatever and and see you next week     
1:16:25     
thank you bye bye see you thank you everyone thank you
