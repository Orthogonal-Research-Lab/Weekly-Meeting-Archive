[Music] hello hello how are     
0:05     
you um pretty good yeah so looks like we've got     
0:12     
Hussein's here hello Hussein and ved's here Hello nice to meet you all nice to meet you     
0:18     
all and     
0:24     
sarov uh so yeah uh sarov would you like to introduce yourself     
0:34     
so so my name is and fromia okay what are you interested in     
0:41     
what are your interests actually     
0:49     
like yeah oh glad to see you here     
0:54     
welcome looks like meul is here as well welcome hi everyone Hi hi Bradley     
1:05     
hi all right and saying is here uh I don't know if you've ever introduced     
1:10     
yourself to the larger group no this is my first time this is my first time help on for Ev okay yeah um hi all nice to     
1:17     
meet you um my name is Hussein I've done some I've done some previous research under Bradley before and I'm hoping to     
1:23     
get on board with de with the deor project I just finished my Graduate Studies at the University of Toronto in     
1:29     
medical Sciences um where I did competitional Neuroscience research moved back here to     
1:34     
the United States while I'm getting involved with a lot of remote positions across Tech science research machine     
1:41     
learning and happy to extend a set of hands to help with good thanks uho would you introduce     
1:50     
yourself yeah yeah sure hi everyone so I am a MS research student at Tri     
1:56     
Hyderabad India uh currently I work in medical image analysis to be specific     
2:01     
brain brain Imaging uh so my work is applying graph neural networks in the     
2:07     
brain data so I am actually I've submitted a paper applying hyper graphs on it and I'm currently working on     
2:13     
directed and sign graphs I'm looking forward to learn from     
2:19     
everyone here yeah uh Morgan is here and so Jesse     
2:24     
Morgan actually does a lot of stuff with neuroimaging so he's interested in that area     
2:30     
um but yeah that's interesting yeah so welcome everyone uh so yeah the     
2:38     
uh so we have a a bunch of things to talk about today so uh let's get started     
2:44     
um unless anyone wanted to give an update on their things that they're doing     
2:50     
uh I don't know I'm doing the math of Tegrity right now um lots of fun in     
2:58     
games linear algebra right     
3:06     
yeah and how about uh vahed are you would you like to give an update yeah U     
3:13     
as you know I've been working on on the developing seon actually the models that     
3:19     
are working on developing seon uh fortunately I could find uh one     
3:25     
study that recently is going to uh is going to uh publish maybe in     
3:32     
the future because in the paper the paper is somehow uh the preprint the     
3:38     
paper that I posted uh in the group as well is a preprint uh which has no data     
3:45     
for now they they have mentioned that in the future when they are going to     
3:50     
publish the paper they will release the code and maybe the data uh but now they they haven't     
3:58     
included the data in in the in the print paper uh so that was     
4:07     
something um hoping maybe in the future we could have some data on uh it's spe     
4:15     
specifically they have worked on L1 uh worm uh yeah they they have some data     
4:22     
regarding the movement of uh uh cegon during its L1 development cycle     
4:31     
and I also found one more publication from 2011 I guess     
4:37     
but they are not that much uh data oriented they they just uh have some     
4:44     
observation on uh and some uh developments during actually some     
4:50     
movement or Locomotion of seans during uh different Lal     
4:56     
States uh but the one that I I found recently maybe they they are working     
5:02     
they they have they have sort of recorded data for uh the     
5:08     
L1 larel stage the the movement of the silons so that would be a little uh     
5:14     
interesting for our modeling uh     
5:21     
approach yeah I saw that in the slack that paper is that the same one or yeah     
5:28     
yeah yeah we take a look at that later so yeah thank you that that's good that you're finding stuff like that there's     
5:34     
always stuff that I've missed or don't know about and I see it come up and I'm like     
5:39     
oh so yeah people are definitely using seans as sort of like a a first place to     
5:45     
go if you're trying to quantify things like development or     
5:50     
so all right so yeah let's get started then uh let me share my     
5:56     
screen and uh I'll have a couple things to say sort of in brief here uh first     
6:03     
thing I want to point people to is that there's uh this new podcast if you're new to openworm this is useful I think     
6:10     
to listen to because it talks a lot this is Steve Larson who's giving the interview here uh he's the CEO of     
6:18     
metacell but he's also one of the founders of the openworm foundation so he talks about uh this is on Spotify he     
6:26     
talks about the openworm project the openm foundation and the sort of I don't     
6:32     
know he gets a little bit into the history but he also talks about you know what you could do with data uh from     
6:39     
celegans so you know this is a very general audience type podcast I don't     
6:44     
know it's like 34 minutes so it's not too long but basically you know the     
6:50     
whole Sort of hope when open noral started was that you would be able to     
6:55     
use cgans as a means to model an organism from like the cells to behavior     
7:02     
and you know have a a good computational model so that you can simulate the worm     
7:08     
so this worm here is a is a microscopy image of a worm but you know we have um     
7:16     
a Docker container that you can download from the GitHub the openworm GitHub and if you     
7:22     
run that Docker container and it it takes a little bit of effort to do so you can get a series of models to run     
7:29     
that model the biophysics of movement that model uh some aspects of the     
7:35     
connectome and some other simulations that are in there that will run you know     
7:40     
kind of like almost like a movie and the idea is that you can take those models     
7:46     
extract like uh information from the simulation use those parameters then to     
7:51     
model celegans and it should match the actual seigan worm and so you know there     
7:59     
I guess because seans is actually a pretty easy target has a lot for example     
8:04     
seans has a tractable connectome 302 cells it has these stereotypical     
8:11     
movements so it can move you know it basically moves only has a couple modes of movement uh generally speaking uh you     
8:18     
can actually model those things and uh we're going to get into the paper that     
8:24     
heed put in the uh slack later so we'll talk about that but basically that's the     
8:30     
hope and and we're not really that close yet but it as you can imagine it's it's a pretty long-term project so this is     
8:37     
yeah this is definitely something you should check out it's on Spotify it's uh     
8:43     
data skeptic is the name of the podcast and this is the episode on     
8:49     
openworm okay yeah so that might be of interest to people another thing is is that every year for Darwin day which is     
8:56     
February 12th I do a post a blog post on the blog that I've been running for like 10 or 15 years now it's actually I think     
9:04     
been 16 years almost um where I pick a topic in biology or evolutionary biology     
9:13     
or in this case biophysics and I kind of go through uh some aspects of of that topic     
9:21     
so this is called Charles Darwin meets rub Goldberg a tile of biological     
9:27     
convoluted so I went to um I went to a generative AI engine and I typed in the     
9:34     
prompt Charles Derwin rubbe Goldberg machine and these are some of the images     
9:39     
I got out so I was glad that I could get this as an image because it didn't exist     
9:44     
in Google uh images so this is basically uh this is supposed to be Charles Darwin     
9:51     
old Charles Darwin and this is something they call rubbe Goldberg machine so if you're not familiar with this this is a     
9:58     
there was a cartoonist at the turn of the last century named rub Goldberg and he had did these cartoons where he drew     
10:05     
these machines that were like these elaborate machines that would do uh some     
10:11     
very simple thing in many steps so it would be like uh I want to build a machine to fluff my pillow and he'd     
10:17     
build a machine that had like a hundred part moving parts to it and it was many many more parts and you needed to     
10:23     
actually do this and so you know it was supposed to be sort of absurd right there 's an absurdity to it and that you     
10:31     
need this many steps and at the time of course in society people were building machines to     
10:37     
improve your life and so there were some pretty outlandish machines at the time that would do things that were sort of     
10:43     
like you know absurd and so that was just a thing that he was lampooning but     
10:48     
these kind of machines are interesting because you know it takes some skill to build them you know you have essentially     
10:54     
a machine that is over specified I guess you could say and the reason you know     
11:01     
there may be lessons in here for biology so if we look at like a a map like a map     
11:07     
of a metabolic Network it's very very complex and the question is is it does     
11:13     
it need to be that complex uh to be optimal or does it exist like this rub     
11:18     
Goldberg machine where you have all these moving parts and maybe more parts than you need and so this is you know this is     
11:25     
another type of image that was generated so in this post they basically talk     
11:31     
about this paper I wrote about uh I think it was about 13 years ago now the     
11:37     
Machinery of Bio complexity and this is a paper where I use these models called     
11:42     
biological rub Goldberg machines and I use them to model uh different processes     
11:48     
and consider you know if this is something that will explain sort of the     
11:53     
evolution of things that you see in nature that maybe aren't optimal or     
11:59     
they're very you know maybe needlessly complex to do something uh to perform a     
12:04     
biological function so I go through some of these possible rub gold uh biological rubbe Goldberg machines and how they     
12:11     
might work so then this whole post is basically uh going through this paper     
12:17     
revisiting it and uh I didn't realize I had given a talk on this a long time ago     
12:23     
at a conference and it you know it was kind of it was it was you know it was okay I mean it wasn't that     
12:29     
wildly received but it had like you know I basically went through this and I got     
12:35     
some feedback so this this current version represents the comments that I got and so there different ways you can     
12:41     
set up these ver Goldberg machines you can set it up as a simple process model and then you can do things like mutate     
12:48     
that process model or Co-op parts of the process model or you can invert parts of it and copy and do all these different     
12:55     
operations and you can end up with this kind of thing that's sort of a machine that's superus in a lot of ways and so     
13:03     
this is kind of the thing we're trying to do you can also do this with a microfluidic model where you change the     
13:10     
shape of the channels and sort of the way that it goes and and this this gives you this sort of complexity something     
13:16     
that looks like complexity and that's that's so the lesson here is that you     
13:22     
know Evolution um you know people always say that evolution is optimal and I     
13:28     
would disagree with that in two ways one is that doesn't often I mean it doesn't always give you optimal things it gives     
13:36     
you things that are sort of fit for the environment and so if organisms are     
13:41     
always moving between environments you can have suboptimal things going on you can have suboptimal     
13:47     
traits uh the second is that you have sort of this uh you know you have things     
13:52     
that gets kind of you have constraints that that evolve you have to evolve within certain constraints and so you     
13:59     
can't always tightly optimize things and so there's this idea in the literature     
14:04     
called construct of neutral Evolution or CN and this is something I cite here and     
14:11     
there's there's been a bunch of work on this in the last 15 years where people have looked at neutral Evolution which     
14:17     
is evolution without like you know an Adaptive um imperative and so this is     
14:24     
something else that's relevant here so yeah this is a oh go ahead I appreciate     
14:30     
I appreciate the analogy and the comparison um a world machine though uh     
14:36     
they are on some level trying to optimize themselves too by being as convoluted as possible yeah like of     
14:41     
course the trajectory the goal of say pouring coffee or you know kicking a ball isn't the isn't the goal it's it's     
14:49     
everything fascinating that occurs before them that leads up to it but you know that's so in that sense it is     
14:56     
optimizing itself to be as flashy and intricate as possible so yeah yeah     
15:03     
yeah yeah that's a it's it's it is it is a neat idea like what what is the most complicated way you can pour water what     
15:10     
is the most um complicated way you can do the final task before you get it done so I think I think group Goldberg     
15:17     
machines as as interesting as they are they're they're more so um into into into the more into the more     
15:24     
like like say fascinating idea of say suboptimal functioning in the sense that whatever is being done before the final     
15:31     
step which is the goal like whether it's um say pouring a cup of water whatever is being done before then for whatever     
15:37     
reason the system is doing such a poor job of integrating information as effectively as efficiently as possible     
15:43     
and as such it resorts to doing 50 other tasks first before doing that role so it's almost like not so much like I mean     
15:50     
you could say it's like trying to make it as complicated as possible but more so it's it's I see it as more of an analogy or a symbol of inefficient     
15:57     
processing so so um but yeah I appreciate that this is a really cool comparison when I was in school I made     
16:04     
one that would like uh do a bunch of stuff and then strum a guitar at the end it would like have a pick fly and it     
16:09     
would strum a guitar and it's like that's how you strum a guitar and it it had like 50 steps before that     
16:15     
yeah yeah yeah I do talk a little bit about that but I never really got to the     
16:21     
point where you know like really kind of thinking deeply about that that's why I kind of brought it back up because and     
16:28     
kind of think about it and I was like well this G seems kind of Unfinished as an idea because on some     
16:34     
level it is optimizing a function of some kind but it is optimizing a function in more so how complicated and     
16:39     
convoluted you can be you know yeah not necessarily with respect to the specific final step yeah so that's U that's what     
16:47     
I would see about yeah well thanks for the comments     
16:53     
yeah yeah so that and so that's uh the uh thing for for Darwin day so that's on     
17:00     
synthetic Daisy's blog which is synthetic daisies blogspot.com and it's the most recent post there so this is     
17:07     
the paper that vahed talked about um this is a so it's a pre-print from     
17:14     
bioarchive and this was posted last year last summer so I think this is the     
17:19     
latest version um and yeah I don't know if they published it anywhere since but this is     
17:27     
uh yeah oh you want to say something V     
17:32     
he uh I was just saying that I've been looking for uh the published version     
17:38     
because uh I found also I uh actually uh     
17:43     
sent the link for uh some maybe uh     
17:50     
the uh popet centrol but uh it has also been     
17:56     
mentioned that it has not yet been peer reviewed by a Jour by Journal so uh it's     
18:02     
not the published version yet and at the end of the uh the paper they have     
18:07     
mentioned that they did not publish any code or data anywhere until they are not     
18:12     
going also to publish until they uh maybe formally publish the paper     
18:21     
somewhere yeah yeah it sounds like what I thought well it was on PubMed but the     
18:27     
PubMed St you know they have preprints on there now so that's that's where we're     
18:33     
pointed um but yeah this is a quantitative analysis of locomoter     
18:39     
patterns in developing celegans so this is where they're looking at Locomotion and the developing seans and by     
18:47     
developing they mean the larvel     
18:53     
stages uh I I also have some uh previews on this paper and another paper which is     
18:58     
a link actually has been mentioned on on L1 if you would like after your     
19:06     
introduction I could uh connect this paper to another one that is actually     
19:11     
somehow is describing how uh different neuron types in L1 and an adult uh C gun     
19:20     
is actually working together to make uh some Locomotion both both swiming and     
19:27     
cro okay yeah let me go over the abstract and then you can do that so yeah so the     
19:34     
um so this is uh let's let's go over the abstract um adult animals display robust     
19:42     
Locomotion at the timeline and mechanisms of how juvenile animals acquire coordinate coordinated movements     
19:49     
now these movements evolve during development are not well understood so we know like the adult movements we have     
19:55     
those characterized and in fact in open worm it's one of the main imperatives of the project is to get they have this     
20:02     
movement database where they've gotten a bunch of microscopy images so you know you'll have seans in a in a culture dish     
20:10     
and you can take an image of them crawl on this uh on this gel that they you     
20:15     
know that that we usually plate them on and so you get these you know movements that they make towards food or whatever     
20:23     
sometimes they're quiescent meaning they stay still but sometimes they move around that space and they try to you     
20:29     
know uh do things like interact with each other and eat food and things like that so but the thing is we don't know     
20:37     
because this this these larel stages are a bit different from the adult uh stages     
20:43     
they're they haven't quite gotten all of their cells yet um you know in the sense that uh there's some postembryonic cell     
20:52     
differentiation and so there we expect maybe some changes in both the connecto     
20:57     
which is people are working on that and then the movement output so that's that's where they're going with this uh     
21:04     
recent advances in quantitative behavioral analyses have ped the way for investigating complex natural behaviors     
21:11     
like Locomotion so you know you can study Locomotion just by simply letting a see alans crawl across the uh the gel     
21:20     
and do their thing and you can just record it and then track it using tracking     
21:26     
algorithms um in this study track the swimming and crawling behaviors of the ne neot sea elegans so they have very     
21:33     
Exquisite swimming behaviors very stereotype but also very good they're very good at swimming in in like liquids     
21:40     
like if there's a thin liquid layer that they have to Traverse they can do that easily but also crawl which is just kind     
21:47     
of moving uh like a worm and then uh they looked at this from post embrionic     
21:53     
development which is this there are these laral stages through adulthood so they did this principal     
21:59     
component analysis and in this paper they use an approach called the enorm approach which is something that uh open     
22:06     
worm is very interested in it's a common approach in seelan movement it's basically using principal component     
22:14     
analysis getting some igen values and then that's like characterizes natural     
22:20     
modes of locomotion so they call them igen worms because they're these igen Valley representations of     
22:26     
movement uh the principal component analysis revealed that adult seelan     
22:32     
swimming is low dimensional suggesting that a small number of distinct postures or igen worms account for most of the     
22:39     
variance in the body shapes that constitute sewing Behavior so they don't have a lot of different distinct types     
22:46     
of movement when they move they use very stereotypical movements so they might undulate back and forth at a certain     
22:54     
frequency and they might have three different modes of doing that and that's about it so it doesn't they don't do these     
23:00     
individualistic sort of adaptive movements they're very stereotyped um they know um which part     
23:08     
of the Sean's brain is um controlling the     
23:13     
movements yeah so there's a movement circuit and it has like I think about six or seven neurons in it and they have     
23:20     
like one mode of that for forward movement and one for backward movement     
23:26     
so it's like if it's going forward there's certain neurons that are activated and then going backwards     
23:32     
another subset is activated but I think there some of uh both movements use some of the same neurons but they they     
23:39     
actually have it well mapped out and there are other papers that talk about that but um     
23:46     
yeah uh then then our analysis revealed that swimming and crawling are distinct gates in adult animals so actually in     
23:54     
laral development they do these movements that are very much much the same they're very low dimensional in     
24:00     
adulthood they kind of diversify their behavior they have these very distinct     
24:05     
uh movements for each type of behavior so they're really refining that and you know the the explanation for that might     
24:12     
be that those circuits are specializing over larval development so they start     
24:18     
with this L1 larvea which is the first larval stage right after they hatch from the egg and then you know you have up to     
24:25     
L4 which is the final larvel stage and then adulthood so throughout the LEL     
24:31     
development developmental period this circuit is is H is sort of uh being     
24:37     
refined and then it different it specializes in these different movements uh     
24:45     
remarkably hey Bradley do you know um I I suppose just in general but also specifically for these sorts of uh these     
24:51     
sorts of studies of igen room space do you know in general how much of this can be extended or generalized to other uh     
24:57     
other species some Rees say like see in a in a in C in like not just SE     
25:05     
elegant yeah yeah well I mean you know they use uh this type of thing there are a lot of species of stereotypical     
25:12     
movements so like not just like uh like worms but like other organisms where     
25:18     
they you know you can track their movement so yeah I don't know what like the state I know they do the enorm stuff     
25:25     
in seans and you can use like that basic approach I think in other organisms uh like you know Marine     
25:32     
invertebrates and other worms and I think inop as well uh but I'm not sure     
25:39     
what the what the literature looks like on that yeah I think the idea here is that     
25:46     
if you have like things that you suspect or stereotypical movements you can like just do the analysis and it'll show that     
25:53     
you know you can maybe use those to characterize the the movement     
25:58     
um so remarkably young L1 larae are capable of producing the postural shapes     
26:04     
for swimming in crawling seen in adults so they have these behaviors that you see in adults despite frequent instances     
26:11     
of uncoordinated body movements so their movements aren't really all totally coordinated yet we talked about how in a     
26:18     
previous meeting how you know in the embryo you start out with these muscle twitches which are when the muscles get     
26:25     
kind of before they even get connected to the connecto and they're differentiating the muscle they twitch     
26:32     
sort of autonomously and then as they connect to the connectone they kind of coordinate their movements and so the L1     
26:39     
has this kind of carryover of uncoordinated movement but they actually do have these behaviors that are you can     
26:46     
see them in L1 but they they're not specialized yet so in contrast late L1     
26:52     
lar exhibit robust coordination of locomotion so this is where this L1     
26:57     
stage is where this is really beginning to specialize uh while many neurons crucial     
27:02     
for adult Locomotion are still under development so you have this core of like seven or eight neurons and then     
27:09     
other neurons are like modulating this circuit and so that's what's maybe going     
27:14     
on in L1 is that that modulation is beginning to be put into place or at     
27:19     
least you know uh learned or you know whatever in conclusion this study     
27:25     
establishes a comprehensive quantitative behavioral framework we understanding the neural basis of locomoter     
27:32     
development so that's that's the abstract um now Ved if you wanted to     
27:39     
talk more about the background or I don't know what you had to share as you     
27:46     
described uh this paper is actually as we said a pre parth uh the main topics     
27:53     
as you covered uh are uh first of all how     
27:58     
they actually quantitized the movement of the worm they they decide to um     
28:06     
actually differentiate 11 parts of the worm into uh different movement shape     
28:13     
which are um more like four different uh gestures that uh every two of them has     
28:21     
been uh decided to be uh categorized as uh one type of move Locomotion which is     
28:29     
swimming and crawling they have put this together to A1 and A2 which are the     
28:36     
movement with uh these angles to swimming and these two A1 and     
28:43     
A2 uh to crawling so that's where they somehow covered uh 90 7% of the     
28:52     
movements uh using these four different gestures and angles     
28:58     
uh but what is interesting for us is uh actually these uh     
29:04     
two uh methods that they have and works they have done they they try to put     
29:11     
different larel stag into the how how the worm is moving a young L one which     
29:18     
is after hatching the late L one after 9 hours of Life L2 which is around 17     
29:26     
hours L2 around 30 hours and L4 and so on which is from 38 hours to     
29:34     
maybe 20 to 24 days of leing of the Seance uh which after L4 the the size of     
29:42     
the worm is usually around one millim but they uh observed that all these L     
29:49     
stage usually try to usually have usually different R     
29:54     
uh some similar swimming and uh crawling pattern but uh the young El     
30:01     
onon cannot reli maintain the swimming uh they also found     
30:10     
that uh the young L1 seon uh the they     
30:16     
have they have some type of imature crawling postures and Locomotion as you     
30:21     
can see here the the blue lines uh describes the uh crawling posture of the     
30:29     
young L1 so they uh concluded that during L1 the especially the nervous system of     
30:37     
the cant is not yet uh major enough to     
30:42     
to uh generate some uh sustained uh rythms for swimming this is     
30:50     
the main actually discoveries they have done but as we mentioned uh they they     
30:58     
are going to put some link over here that's the code that which is really     
31:04     
interesting for us in Python is going to be published SO waiting for the code and     
31:10     
date but uh what's Susan was mentioned could be maybe found in in a paper like     
31:18     
these Elegance Locomotion SM circuits complex functions uh in this paper it's     
31:24     
uh it's a little old for 2011 I guess but during this work they have     
31:33     
uh similar to many other uh papers like this they have tried to     
31:41     
uh somehow differentiate dorsal and ventral muscles that silons have and uh     
31:50     
some specifically those cells and interneurons and neurons that are uh     
31:57     
somehow interesting for The Locomotion of cegon we can if we have these six     
32:03     
inter Neons and these uh other six ones which are connected to muscle cells you     
32:09     
can somehow figure out how uh what is the central uh uh actually     
32:18     
uh nervous system of silons which part is actually responsible for the     
32:25     
generation of some movement both crawling and     
32:30     
uh uh and both both of both types of The Locomotion but here again they     
32:37     
discovered they showed that the the L1 is lacking some type of inter neurons     
32:43     
which are uh for for the adult one is responsible for generating forward and     
32:50     
backward patterns here in the old one only they it is using three of those six     
32:58     
noes and interns for generating the pattern so we can maybe conclude that     
33:05     
uh somehow not trying to not uh having enough maybe internal during the elone     
33:13     
could be responsible for uh that type of not sustaining uh movement patterns     
33:24     
also uh also we have another paper over here that if uh other one are interested     
33:32     
this is the main paper that uh the open Worm Project especially it's muscle uh     
33:39     
cell is trying actually body wall muscles or and our simulation that we have done uh and     
33:48     
the code available uh is based on this work uh somehow you can see the all     
33:55     
types of uh uh the formulation of those patterns     
34:04     
that uh we have during we could see are responsible     
34:10     
for generating the movement patterns it is somehow the Electrical uh the     
34:16     
equivalent circuits for uh those patterns and we have use this and we     
34:21     
have the code available uh on open world GitHub uh and as I describe somehow I'm     
34:30     
going to use some similar uh maybe approach to try to     
34:38     
understand maybe the difference between the L1 and uh the laral state and the     
34:45     
adult stage of the Silicon def defense in movements and uh specifically find to     
34:53     
and understand how different neural networks and the seon during its laral     
35:00     
stage and its L stage is going to uh make some     
35:05     
distinguishable uh pattern durations and so uh somehow some artificial n That     
35:13     
Could derived from such a     
35:18     
work great that's great um so distinguishable means like you     
35:25     
know a specific function or just like kind of distinguishing it with the igen     
35:30     
worms like that they're different uh yeah of course if we are going to     
35:37     
quantize uh the the and as you saw uh and you     
35:43     
describe here the the quantifying The Locomotion is of course related to the     
35:50     
different igen worms and if we are going to work on that maybe the number of     
35:55     
different I words that are somehow uh related to maybe     
36:01     
different types of uh neural networks and combination of of those NE maybe uh     
36:09     
could be uh could uh somehow move our work from a simple model which is and     
36:16     
how and uh over is L one adult in it L1     
36:23     
Lara stage actually tries to generate the patterns uh brings us to a more     
36:30     
complex one which is of course the adult one yeah I I think there's uh but what I     
36:38     
was thinking was that there is there are data sets uh where like they look at     
36:43     
synapse uh development in the LEL stages so there're data sets that exist that     
36:50     
show kind of like the so like the idea in larvel stage worms is that there's     
36:55     
there these synapses is that sometimes they're persistent meaning that you get an early     
37:01     
synaptic um you know connection and it persists throughout development and into adulthood some of them however are sort     
37:09     
of transient meaning that they kind of are there and then they go away and you     
37:14     
know so there's this data set that um I'll have to kind of go over in more     
37:21     
detail later uh where they have these characterized for different uh con     
37:26     
between different neurons so we know the connectivity of the connectome from uh     
37:32     
you know different uh basically from um uh Gap Junction studies so they look at     
37:39     
like the cells you know if they make contact and they have a gap Junction that's a connection they do this from uh     
37:45     
microscopy work so they they you know look at the cells they track the cells and where they have Junctions the other     
37:52     
way you can do it is look at the synapses and that's harder but it gives you a different map of connectivity     
37:57     
because it tells you kind of what maybe functionally is going on so these changes might very well be reflected in     
38:04     
some of the synaptic wiring that happens and changes yeah and uh actually another     
38:12     
approach would be maybe molecular level because we are both working on cellular     
38:18     
level and on uh maybe the construction of the of all these compart compartments     
38:25     
uh at the end I'm trying TR to uh somehow compare those everything that is going to be related to cellular level     
38:33     
especially I channels and those which are at the network level which are     
38:39     
usually the wiring of the those uh interactions between muscle cells and     
38:45     
neurons so I'm trying to have both uh points of view have yeah have they     
38:52     
looked at um muscle twitches in relation to the development     
38:59     
of of the connections in the the brain cells uh well the muscle twitches that     
39:07     
you see in the embryo it's it's kind of hard to get a handle on that I mean you get like uh the when the connectone     
39:15     
starts to wire up as it were you get like a few things wired up and then you get a lot of things wired up like in a     
39:21     
very short period of time so like the muscle twitching is kind of hard to know kind of what's happening it's probably     
39:27     
just kind of as the muscle cells differentiate and they're sential cells     
39:33     
so they have multiple nuclei but you get these muscle cells that differentiate and then they get you know they get     
39:39     
contacted by neurons uh and then they they you know maintain the muscle so it     
39:45     
doesn't like go away and then um all of that you know there's twitching that     
39:50     
happens so the muscle can sort of get practice firing you know uh firing and     
39:55     
being active and then you know the when the connections are made with the connecto it starts to get refined but yeah I     
40:02     
don't know what's happening like in L1 versus I don't know of any data set in like the embryo that tells us anything     
40:09     
about muscle twitching maybe like there's some gene expression that says oh yeah there gene expression data that     
40:15     
says oh yeah late embryo uh maybe there's some muscle genes that muscle related genes that are     
40:21     
really highly upregulated versus like L1 and it actually I know that those data     
40:27     
sets exist for those things so those are those are kind of interesting um I might     
40:33     
take a look at that I I have the data I've been working with the data sets for another paper that's why I bring it up     
40:39     
but um oh yeah right     
40:47     
yeah yeah muscles and nerves kind of go together like they're like part of the     
40:54     
same system     
41:00     
yeah well that's great Ved so um did they don't so they don't have data sets     
41:07     
for what they're doing yeah so they yeah they uh but what what     
41:13     
what would you say is like the next thing you'd like to do there like I know you've been kind of working on this big     
41:18     
review document um um     
41:24     
uh if if you could have those I'm still looking for any new data or something     
41:30     
that could be uh digitized even from some all papers uh if there could be any     
41:39     
uh data available I may try to uh to somehow use the same approach     
41:46     
we use for for the adult uh uh actually a simulation of The     
41:54     
Locomotion try to use some similar one for uh the L1 stage uh however here we     
42:02     
we need some uh some maybe uh some data     
42:08     
that could uh could put it in a way that both the the neural networks of the     
42:15     
system and also the mechanical model the biome mechanical model of the system     
42:20     
could be described very well we are trying to understand the uh equivalent     
42:26     
call with this simulation uh some something similar to the paper     
42:34     
boil and Quin I uh presented but uh we are trying to minimize that in in the     
42:41     
level of L stage so if for example a recorded L stag is uh somehow has some     
42:49     
movements in some uh Locomotion uh slower or something     
42:56     
different with different patterns we could understand how different uh maybe     
43:02     
combination of neural networks that are responsible for The Locomotion could be     
43:09     
uh again I'm saying minimized the less compartment we are going to use in in a     
43:16     
new maybe model could be described how uh maybe a minimized model of locomotion     
43:24     
uh could be enough for for The Locomotion of silicon and maybe some other uh networks are responsible     
43:32     
for different uh behaviors of the C on so this is something that uh is the main     
43:41     
uh point of interest in in such a study I'm still looking for data as well but     
43:46     
trying to see if it is possible to estimate some of them as well     
43:52     
especially uh regarding the size of the C in the lbr stage and the one stage so     
43:58     
we could maybe uh estimate that uh with that much uh that size for example if     
44:07     
the the L1 size is uh less than I guess half of     
44:12     
the the the adult Bond and the number of muscle cells     
44:17     
which are less than the uh both muscle and neuron cells which are less than the     
44:23     
adult one during which are responsible for so how it could be estimated that that     
44:29     
much data and required compartment we could regenerate     
44:36     
the same model so it it would be both the validity of the of the adult     
44:43     
muscle um uh model that we have and again as I'm saying uh the minimal     
44:51     
requirements for uh generating something like that     
45:00     
yeah when you say minimal requirements you mean like for the worm     
45:07     
or uh yeah for sure yeah like like it would be like what the worm has to do     
45:12     
minimally to yeah yeah yeah so like um     
45:18     
yeah we don't know like what what the what it's actually doing but we know what it has to do     
45:23     
basically yeah because lots of uh the stimulations that we are dealing with right now uh is somehow maybe a lot of     
45:32     
them are estimated so one more thing we need is to if we are going to understand     
45:38     
or to model the uh SE during different different lar stage we would need it's     
45:46     
something like uh there is there is a sample there's a     
45:52     
actually it has been mentioned in one of the papers that I've been describing that it's somehow looks like uh the     
46:00     
learning mechanism in a uh in a CH in in our children you can say a child during     
46:07     
different states how it could how it could learn to uh to use different     
46:13     
neural networks for uh talking for     
46:18     
uh running and any behavior that they have we we could use the some     
46:24     
similar um points of view for the sance different means that different     
46:32     
learning algorithms are working the Elegance to uh so that it could learn     
46:39     
how could better stream or better crawl and this is the main point for for for     
46:48     
this study of course uh so adding different parts or compartment at each     
46:55     
stage could uh uh make it more make     
47:01     
different models more robust and uh at the end it could say that at at each     
47:09     
Lara stage what what new maybe     
47:15     
uh learning patterns are going to be generated     
47:23     
yeah that's great um so does anyone else have any thoughts     
47:28     
about that I don't know if uh Morgan had any thoughts on it or if anyone else were     
47:35     
curious about like add questions for Ved do the worms     
47:41     
learn they learn do they kind have a memory yeah they have a memory um I know     
47:48     
people have done associative memory studies in in worms with food and things like that but uh I don't know what     
47:55     
they're I I don't know like too much about the learning studies other than that they exist but yeah they do they     
48:02     
they can learn and of course they have like acquisition and everything I don't know people have done like in larvel     
48:10     
development versus adult though get interesting all right so that that's     
48:16     
great thank you V look forward to seeing more on that I've been looking over your document I don't have anything to add     
48:22     
right now but I'll be I'll be uh working on it it might take a while to get through     
48:29     
it yeah so yeah uh Hussein had to leave thank you Hussein for attending uh there's a a a set of papers     
48:37     
that are coming out um and so uh it's on someone called Irvin Bower so Irvin     
48:44     
Bower was a very early theoretical biologist I think he was like one of the first theoretical     
48:51     
biologists and uh he was from Eastern Europe from the Soviet Union in     
48:57     
Hungary um and so he did a lot of things with uh theoretical biology and there     
49:04     
have been a number of papers that are coming out sort of in honor of Irving B Irving Bower and he has an interesting     
49:11     
connection to a lot of the early uh complexity theorists as well so this is     
49:18     
uh this is his Wikipedia um stub and talking about his     
49:24     
research here so he was one of the first uh theoretical bio uh biologists he was     
49:30     
interested in the general thermodynamic features of living system so he published a monograph in 1935 called     
49:38     
theoretical biology where he goes over this stuff and uh so he are you sharing your     
49:45     
screen oh yeah yeah let me share my screen oh thank you     
49:50     
yeah all right there we go so this is his Wikipedia profile um and so uh he     
49:58     
formulated the principle of stable non-equilibrium state which is like a concept that's very similar to like     
50:06     
non-equilibrium thermodynamics and other Concepts that people have come up with like dissipative structures and things     
50:12     
like that if you've heard of those terms uh so they there are a bunch of people at this time were kind of working on     
50:20     
these basic ideas and so they're kind of percolating at this point um so he     
50:26     
formulated this principle would you considered as the basic characteristics of living matter according to Bower     
50:32     
living systems function at the expense of non-equilibrium and the external energy is used not directly to perform     
50:40     
work but to support the stable non-equilibrium State B's principle is incorporated into     
50:46     
nonlinear thermodynamics or the nonlinear thermodynamics of irreversible     
50:51     
processes so irreversible processes just means that you know when we talk about     
50:56     
something like entropy and the second law thermodynamics that those processes aren't reversible you can't go backwards     
51:04     
in time you can't go backwards in the process of entropy so he had a lot to     
51:09     
say about that uh mainly with respect to like open versus closed systems so a lot     
51:15     
of stuff having to do with the second law thermodynamics involves closed systems and characterize the closed     
51:21     
systems and what happens you know in life of course is that it's a very open system meaning it doesn't have you know     
51:28     
that you always have energy coming into it and so most you know characterizations of the second law     
51:35     
involve sort of no energy coming in you have a fixed amount of energy and you watch things run down to entropy and     
51:43     
that's the way you characterize it so this is how we've characterized entropy traditionally what he's saying is that     
51:49     
living systems are are very open get you know there's all sorts of energy coming from different places     
51:56     
and so you have a lot of things that we have to sort of biology is distinct from physics in that respect um and so that     
52:04     
that's what he's getting at with this um so living systems in this framework cannot support their organization only     
52:11     
due to the influx of external energy an example being the ordering     
52:16     
internal factors involved uh so the activity of living systems is fully determined by the internal pattern of     
52:23     
its non-equilibrium state and any work performed by the biological system itself appears as the work of its     
52:30     
structural forces so Evolution according to power corresponds to an increase in     
52:36     
external work which aims to exploit additional resources to maintain     
52:42     
evolving biosystems so again he's like distinguishing this from physics where     
52:48     
you have uh Clos     
52:53     
systems so he's actually uh he was actually a contemporary of various complexity     
53:02     
theorists and so there's a paper here um this is uh this is the DOI here I can't     
53:11     
remember where I got this this is a screenshot of it but I couldn't get access to this article this is uh the     
53:18     
organism in the open system irin Bower and lwig Von uh Berto lne Berto lne was     
53:24     
uh complexity theorist and an early theoretical biologist as well and so     
53:30     
they talk talk about the different connections between these two people's work Howard PTI was also an early uh     
53:38     
theoretical biologist and so all these people had very compatible ideas and     
53:43     
they were kind of hitting upon the same thing but you know wasn't quite all sketched out in fact it's not all     
53:48     
sketched out now which is what I'll get to with the the actual paper that I'll     
53:53     
be talking about soon um so the abstract here is that in this     
54:00     
historical Treatise two biological system theories formulated in 1920s and     
54:05     
30s are roughly sketched the first part discusses the concept of a thermodynamically open system is coined     
54:13     
by the Russian pathologist derin Bower like uh ber lne Bower wanted to prove     
54:18     
the specificity of the biological sciences against physics so they wanted to show that biologic iCal Sciences were     
54:26     
a specific instance of physics they were separate from physics and maybe they have their own rules that exist so you     
54:34     
know it's not that biology is non-physical it's just that it's an extension of what we know from     
54:39     
physics to achieve this he postulated the necessity to formulate specific Laws of Motion which are valid for living     
54:47     
matter alone so this is where we go from like the second law thermodynamics to like say the first law which is a law of     
54:54     
conservation or you know there other things that were the you know Laws of Motion are     
55:00     
constrained in physics trajectories are constrained by the energy consumption and their entropy and of course what     
55:07     
he's saying is that living systems have a different because they open systems you know they behave a little bit     
55:14     
differently and this is important of course in reproduction and in some of the energy uh consumption patterns of     
55:21     
living systems so we know living systems you know do a lot of things uh very     
55:27     
minimal energy so this this might be one of these things that they're trying to get at     
55:33     
here I have a book whole book on hypoxia oh yeah yeah um cells behave     
55:41     
differently depending on the level of oxygen okay and activity of the     
55:46     
mitochondria like that's connected and like they're stiffer without oxygen um     
55:54     
it dramatically changes the mechanical properties yeah so I've been trying to     
56:03     
get at that with the things I'm writing because if it's alive it behaves     
56:09     
differently than if it's dead so if you take a piece of tissue out of a living     
56:15     
creature and measure its mechanical properties you are not getting the mechanical properties of the live and     
56:23     
living creature that do measuring yeah yeah so I have this this whole huge book     
56:30     
on hypoxia     
56:35     
yeah yeah so yeah and then in the second part of the paper the organismic system     
56:43     
system theory of the Austrian Canadian philosopher uh lwin uh Von Burton L     
56:50     
Lany yeah brto Lany uh is outlined the focus of this Theory relied on the     
56:55     
process dynamics that is inherent inside an organismic system so they're they're talking about like an organism and the     
57:03     
process in inside an organism and that it's an open system so we can't model it     
57:09     
as like a closed system where an organism serves as the boundaries of an organism serves as the boundaries of the     
57:14     
system and so they kind of get at some of these processes within the organism and remember this is back in the mid     
57:22     
20th century or even the early 20 Century so this is not you know the     
57:27     
latest kind of data that we have on molecular uh biology or metabolic uh     
57:34     
networks or any of that this is just kind of like you know what we think is going on um inside the     
57:42     
organism both theories exemplify closure models for a living organism from a methodological point of view that     
57:48     
distinguishes these earlier models from something called semantic closure developed by Howard PTI as an EP     
57:54     
systemic clue in solving the Enigma of living phenomena so they get into this this is kind of jargony but they get     
58:01     
into some of the ways that you might model this and how you might consider     
58:06     
the organism is having these biological boundaries as being sort of semi closed     
58:12     
versus like the influxes of energy which which keep it open and and you know     
58:17     
having these sort of energy uh these production requirements with respect to     
58:23     
the energy consumed in an organism so the objective here is to disclose the     
58:28     
essential differences between the conceptions of closure and so this is pretty technical stuff to encourage     
58:35     
further research on closure the essay concludes the few questions concerning clarification of the terms so this kind     
58:42     
of goes through a number of uh citations here from you know older Works uh that     
58:48     
are relevant here so people have been working on this sort of physio mathematical Foundation of biology for     
58:55     
quite a while it's just that you know we have all these Concepts out in the literature and the question is how do we     
59:02     
pull them in and like kind of uh you know make use of them with the modern data sets that we have so you know     
59:08     
there're all these tools um and so that that's what we're doing here so this brings us to the     
59:15     
modern day and so there are a number of papers coming out um our friend here air     
59:21     
uh urv who we we actually P dick and I published with him in a special issue a     
59:28     
couple years ago um he put out this paper called towards the relational     
59:34     
formulation of biological thermodynamics so this is about you know this is using     
59:40     
a specific sort of approach to looking at biological thermodynamics is this     
59:45     
unique thing so uh there are a couple other papers in in memorium of Irvin     
59:52     
Bower so I'm not going to get into those papers but I'll talk about this paper a little bit and then finish up the     
59:58     
meeting so uh the abstract reads classical thermodynamics employs the     
1:00:04     
state of thermodynamic equilibrium characterized by maximal disorder of the constituent particles as the reference     
1:00:11     
frame from which the second law is formulated and the definition of entropy is derived so this is what he's talking     
1:00:17     
about is like the classical statistical mechanics model of where you have like a     
1:00:22     
landscape of partic that are you know at different energetic States and you start     
1:00:29     
out there and you have a closed system and then the energy decreases as time     
1:00:34     
goes on because there's no new energy coming in and those particles being in all these different energetic States     
1:00:40     
settle into minimal energetic States and as minimal energetic States Define a     
1:00:46     
landscape that defines this sort of um this sort of entropy profile so entropy     
1:00:54     
is where things kind of go from these different energetic states to Disorder so where they're in these minimal     
1:01:00     
energetic States uh the implication being that there structural order in the     
1:01:06     
original state and then you run down to this uh minimal state so this is what     
1:01:11     
this is the classic thermodynamics view of entropy um and this is not something     
1:01:17     
that you see in open systems as much because you have constant flux of energy in so that energy landscape gets     
1:01:23     
disrupted you start and you can maintain some of that structure um so non-equilibrium     
1:01:30     
thermodynamics analyzes the fluxes of matter and energy that are generated in the course of the general tendency to     
1:01:36     
achieve equilibrium so the whole point of like uh life I guess is to achieve     
1:01:43     
equilibrium so when you have energy coming in it's you know a means to maintain equilibrium so systems like for     
1:01:50     
example physiological systems are often said to be in homeostasis and     
1:01:56     
homeostasis is this equilibrium with respect to thermodynamics um now you have     
1:02:02     
non-equilibrium thermodynamics because you have fluxes of energy so these fluxes of energy kind of push you know     
1:02:09     
besides providing energy for the living system to keep it from running down to Total disorder you also have these     
1:02:17     
fluxes of energy and the consequence of that and because we have fluxes of energy from the environment that's how     
1:02:23     
it comes packaged in like sunlight or in food or whatever and the challenge of     
1:02:28     
the organism is to maintain a stable state in the face of all that so that's     
1:02:34     
what he's getting at there the systems described by classical and non-equilibrium     
1:02:39     
thermodynamics may be heris useful within certain limits but they have a fund there's a fundamental problem the     
1:02:45     
application to living systems and he mentions autopoetic living systems which is just a way to say that the system is     
1:02:53     
complex system system is trying to maintain some sort of equilibrium we discuss here the Paradigm     
1:02:59     
defined as a relational biological thermodynamics the standard to which this refers relates to the biological     
1:03:06     
function operating within the context of a particular environment and not to the abstract state of thermodynamic     
1:03:12     
equilibrium so this is just kind of thinking about the environment as the thing that sets this biological function     
1:03:19     
of of homeostasis uh this is defined as the St non equilibrium State following irin     
1:03:26     
Bower so this is kind bringing back to Irvin Bower and his stable non-equilibrium state so that's what he     
1:03:33     
calls us and it's basic way like homeostasis or something similar and like I said these terms were all being     
1:03:40     
used by different people back in the early to mid 20th century so there maybe     
1:03:45     
there's some discontinuity in terms of you know a formal theoretical model but     
1:03:50     
they're all basically getting at similar things so similar to physics we're     
1:03:55     
abandoning the absolute SpaceTime resulted in the application of nonukan geometry so when uh Einstein came up     
1:04:03     
with his uh Rel you know general relativity and and U his relativity uh     
1:04:10     
Concepts you know they abandon this idea of The Ether or of absolute SpaceTime     
1:04:16     
with respect to you know how the universe was structured um so he this is     
1:04:22     
a relation he thinks of this as a sort of a relational way of doing this and then he says okay we can do the same     
1:04:28     
thing in biological thermodynamics and have this sort of relational biological thermodynamics and this may lead to     
1:04:34     
revealing the basic iterative structures that are formed as a consequence of the search for an optimal coordinate system     
1:04:41     
by living organisms so these living organisms are trying to put everything     
1:04:47     
into this framework of you know maintaining a stable non-e equilibrium     
1:04:52     
and so it's but it's relative to to the organism's environment to the organism structure and so     
1:04:58     
forth through this search the developing system achieves the condition of maximization of its power by a     
1:05:05     
synergistic effects which is a fancy way of saying that there are these uh you know non nonlinear effects that happen     
1:05:11     
when things interact and that gives it the power to do this sort of U maintaining its its uh sort of non     
1:05:19     
thermody or non-equilibrium thermodynamics so this this is nice this is a nice tour of some Concepts uh     
1:05:26     
talking about Ilia prene and some of his thoughts about the second law and you     
1:05:32     
know this is again another person who thought in terms of biology being an open thermodynamic system and kind of     
1:05:39     
the consequences of that and so this is a nice paper it ties together a lot of     
1:05:45     
Concepts and I'm not going to get into the details of the paper but to say that this is something people have been     
1:05:50     
thinking about for a long time and you know maybe they there are some updates to this and looks like people are     
1:05:56     
publishing updates on it and it's interesting to see what they have to     
1:06:02     
say so I see that uh Susan posted a link to some hypoxia work that's been done U     
1:06:09     
it's a methodological work so hypoxia is a good example of like energetics and     
1:06:14     
maintaining homeostatic State uh with respect to energetics and oxygen     
1:06:21     
consumption a lot of interesting work there um you know we think we know about things different physiological functions     
1:06:28     
but a lot of times we know very little because we have sort of idealized data in a lot of cases and so you know     
1:06:36     
sometimes you have n uh individual variation in how people metabolize     
1:06:41     
things sometimes you have people who perform at a very high level relative to the rest of the population then of     
1:06:48     
course we have different species where they have different specializations for dealing with low oxygen     
1:06:55     
environments um like in deep sea organisms and things like that so they're they're     
1:07:01     
different um different ways of doing this uh so then Susan asked what system     
1:07:07     
does not go to disorder answer life yeah so life doesn't go to disorder until it     
1:07:13     
dies and then it's disordered uh but you has to maintain life and so that's a     
1:07:18     
good question about life you say what is life it's not equilibrium thermodynamic     
1:07:24     
but what does that mean it means you're not dead I guess     
1:07:30     
so and then you know it's like a non-answer it's like a I'll Define it when it's not dead you know it's like so     
1:07:39     
that that's that's where we are with that um I gave a physics teacher a bad time     
1:07:45     
with that one yeah so they're you know they're     
1:07:51     
physicists who's you know have very like kind a constrained view of thermodynamics and then you have     
1:07:57     
biophysicists who have to deal with applying that to an open system and then you have people like you     
1:08:04     
know philosophers in that who talk about you know uh thermody dynamics of life but     
1:08:11     
then don't actually deal with like experimental data so it's like we have     
1:08:16     
these different perspectives on it and getting it unified is you know it's     
1:08:22     
tough um part of part of this is uh um the change of pH changes the way     
1:08:33     
proteins are folded and so you change the oxygen     
1:08:40     
level and it changes the ph and that changes the um molecular level of     
1:08:48     
things um it kind of fits together have I have another paper it's     
1:08:55     
more like a um thesis that somebody wrote about     
1:09:01     
um interest um     
1:09:06     
uh intermediate filaments I think it was okay yeah and yeah and she was talking     
1:09:13     
about uh pH is being a factor in this that stress strain curve     
1:09:22     
right they can you can get yeah tell you the elasticity of various     
1:09:32     
molecules vermenton I think she was into looking at vermenton as one of the main     
1:09:40     
intermediate filaments     
1:09:45     
um do you want that reference like yeah that would be good yeah I'll try to look     
1:09:51     
it up all right um yeah I know we've talked about     
1:09:57     
intermediate filaments before and it's interesting so in that case we have like     
1:10:03     
an environmental condition that actually sets sort of how that stress string     
1:10:08     
curve looks so it's like all the things about the biophysical Properties or the mechanical properties of whatever you     
1:10:14     
have is you know mediated by this this factor in the environment so different     
1:10:21     
organisms perhaps with different people H is uh they they they behave     
1:10:26     
differently or in different uh chemical uh regimes yeah I think that     
1:10:33     
one of the more interesting things is the difference between warm-blooded and     
1:10:38     
coldblooded um animals yeah so     
1:10:45     
yeah that's also interesting let's see oh I just have to look this up it starts     
1:10:51     
with s right I have to find my     
1:10:59     
references so Susan's doing that does anyone else I'll write it down all right uh     
1:11:07     
does anyone else have anything else to say uh while she's doing that just the you know the the usual Argin of life     
1:11:17     
kind of um perspective on this in terms of you know the generation of um it's     
1:11:25     
not just the generation of biomolecules or you know it's the it's protocells and     
1:11:31     
Metabolism as being the two kind of um key key components U and yeah and they're their     
1:11:40     
their work to maintain a the the ordered system     
1:11:47     
yeah that's good thank you yeah I didn't bring up early life     
1:11:52     
but we've talked about that in the group and one of the reasons we are interested in that is because it's well first of     
1:11:58     
all it's a simple system kind of like se elans but also because you know it does give insights into sort of this     
1:12:05     
biological regulation these regimes of Regulation which maintain a system a     
1:12:11     
biological system so that's something we don't really do much in openworm per se     
1:12:17     
is kind of get at that that question like we don't have like a physiological model of sort of house     
1:12:24     
heans maintains its state uh but you know it's it's part of life so it's part     
1:12:30     
of simulating wife would be simulating those conditions     
1:12:39     
so all right I guess Susan is coming up with some answers in the chat here uh there     
1:12:47     
we go any other comments before we go it's like an Shepherds     
1:12:54     
2022 intermediate filament mechanics across scale from single filaments     
1:12:59     
single interactions and networks and cells now this is a sort of a specialized publication but it's     
1:13:06     
something if you're interested you know you can look it up     
1:13:12     
um okay yeah I thought it was interesting     
1:13:18     
yeah it covers more than ver mention but that was the main filament that     
1:13:24     
I noticed I I think there was also cartin in     
1:13:30     
there okay yeah I I haven't mentioned um Bradley I     
1:13:38     
never never did a good synopsis of the advanced microscopy workshop at Berkeley     
1:13:43     
okay before photonics West I was just thinking about some of the the the Imaging that they did of of filaments um     
1:13:51     
Susan made me think of that and uh and just yeah some of the other kind of     
1:13:57     
techniques they had for for looking at kind of specific more specific aspects of the     
1:14:03     
cell cell infrastructure and things like that that was focused exactly on um you     
1:14:12     
know Imaging microtubules cell cell um     
1:14:17     
what did she call it I mean it was something like Stell infrastructure     
1:14:23     
or something like that but it was really like like the Imaging of of you know     
1:14:29     
filaments microtubules in action and and lots of you know kind of     
1:14:36     
bioh physics U yeah biophysics of the cell I can totally get that yeah I'll     
1:14:44     
I'll find that I'm I'm I'm actually still on the school run kids school run here so that's okay yeah soon as soon as     
1:14:53     
I got my hands available I'll check that but but lots of really lots of great     
1:15:00     
talks um and um um in particular I just wanted to say um the the head of the     
1:15:09     
Chan Zuckerberg biohub Imaging uh group um L something um l i     
1:15:19     
oh I'm blanking on his last anyway he had a great he had a great uh U demo of uh chat GPT     
1:15:29     
and and Pari you know the um that python framework for microscopy that um that     
1:15:37     
Jen Zuckerberg by Hub kind of um I don't want to     
1:15:43     
say I forget who exactly wrote it but anyway but they've been a big proponent of it um a Big Thunder of it anyway     
1:15:54     
it's just a it's like a an Imaging it's kind of like a um a Fiji you know     
1:16:01     
imagej like app yeah and he was he was just showing like chat GPT writing code     
1:16:09     
for plugins in Inari and it being both a great way to learn how to code as well as to generate     
1:16:17     
functionality it was it was really cool anyway there was there was lots to cover in that that would be     
1:16:24     
good to go over yeah yeah well I I have one image of a cell and it shows a     
1:16:30     
microtubule mat all the way across the the top of the cell and then I have     
1:16:37     
others where there's just act in there and I know yeah I know they both occur     
1:16:42     
and sometimes more one than the other and like I would be very interested in     
1:16:50     
having more pictures more images that's one missing is I'm trying trying to make a     
1:16:56     
structure and I don't know what it looks like in real life because because there's no three damages     
1:17:02     
of the inside of cell sure sure now this this is this was     
1:17:08     
like the focus of her her Labs uh her lab's work yeah so I I'll I'll find her     
1:17:15     
name I mean pretty pretty sure want to say she's a a Berkeley Prof um but uh I     
1:17:23     
I'll get to that no worries thany yeah kind of important     
1:17:28     
here if I had some more 3D images of cells actual     
1:17:36     
cells it would be great yeah we should go through uh you     
1:17:42     
know the imagej's Fiji ecosystem at some point because they've there's a lot of     
1:17:47     
stuff where you know there's open source tools everywhere and it's just kind of hard to yeah yeah no I I only kind of     
1:17:55     
discovered some some Frameworks recently that are um     
1:18:02     
uh I don't know if I want to say built on Fiji or kind of built around it in     
1:18:08     
the sense of um like almost like get you know a like     
1:18:15     
a like an app like an app store for Fiji oh okay yeah yeah yeah I've used it     
1:18:23     
image J before yeah so so I mean I remember image J as an     
1:18:28     
undergrad um but it see you know looking at like what janelia and and again like     
1:18:37     
most of the people who were covering um the image processing     
1:18:42     
pipelines at at this this Workshop were focused on um focused on     
1:18:48     
Fiji yeah interesting yeah yeah and ifer to work for some data I have and I I put     
1:18:57     
it into Fuji and it um overwhelms my     
1:19:02     
computer well so so this this um check out uh I want to say it's     
1:19:09     
nari like NP r i yeah     
1:19:16     
and yeah I forget if it's like fund by buub     
1:19:24     
or or it was originally them um but then funded by     
1:19:32     
um what's the because it's python tool it might be focused might be um num     
1:19:38     
Focus funed I forget now but okay I think it may be     
1:19:45     
yeah yeah that's great um yeah so thanks yeah that was great I'm glad that you     
1:19:51     
had uh fun at the uh Workshop there and it sounds like it was uh maybe we can do     
1:19:58     
more formal thing I mean even at our Saturday meeting if you want to do     
1:20:04     
that so let me know if you're where it's happening okay     
1:20:11     
yeah all right uh well thanks for attending everyone and um see yeah see     
1:20:17     
you next week okay bye bye thank you and goodbye     
1:20:22     
thank you bye yes there bye bye so now I'd like to follow up on a     
1:20:30     
paper I talked about last week and so last week I talked about this paper     
1:20:36     
threedimensional soft streaming and this was mainly a material science paper that     
1:20:41     
talked about fluid mechanics and fluid dynamics with respect to something called viscous streaming so this is     
1:20:49     
something where there's this a a a sort of a stream in of liquid around a body     
1:20:55     
and they talked about softbed objects and they talked about some things that were related to biology and so it wasn't     
1:21:03     
specifically a biology paper but it had a lot of things to do with uh the     
1:21:08     
compliance of soft materials and the kinds of things we would see in tissue     
1:21:14     
morphogenesis and in tissue mechanics a lot of that was about flow control and     
1:21:20     
so that gives it that sets up this paper which is much more sort of oriented     
1:21:25     
towards biology so this is a paper out of nature physics uh this was uh published online     
1:21:33     
in January so last month and this is called self-organized inter cellular     
1:21:40     
Twisters so here are the authors here and I'll go through the abstract     
1:21:45     
and we'll kind of see how these two papers form a theme uh they're talking in this case     
1:21:51     
about different types of flows that are connected to this kind of streaming activity they're going to talk about     
1:21:57     
this in the dropa oite so the abstract reads life in     
1:22:03     
complex systems such as cities and organisms comes to a standstill when     
1:22:08     
Global coordination of mass energy and information flow is disrupted Global coordination is no less important in     
1:22:15     
single cells especially in large OS sites and newly formed embryos which commonly use fast fluid flows where     
1:22:22     
Dynamic reorganization of their cytoplasm Bea cytoplasmic streaming     
1:22:27     
flows have been proposed to spontaneously arise from hydrodynamic interactions among cortically anchored     
1:22:34     
microtubules loaded with cargo carrying molecular Motors so they talk about     
1:22:39     
cytoplasmic streaming flows and so these are streaming in the cytoplasm these are     
1:22:44     
constantly moving flows that are occurring uh they they spontaneously     
1:22:49     
arise from hydrodynamic interactions among microtubules that are anchored uh     
1:22:56     
loaded with cargo carrying molecular Motors so the molecular Motors are using this cytoplasm streaming flow they arise     
1:23:04     
from these hydrodynamic interactions within the cell and that that's where we're going with this so we had the idea     
1:23:11     
of streaming in the last paper this paper we're talking about the same kind of streaming idea but in the cytoplasm     
1:23:21     
specifically here we combine modeling and simulation with live Imaging to investigate such flows in the dsop oite     
1:23:28     
so this is in a model organism D Sao oite in the embryo using a fast accurate and     
1:23:35     
scalable numeric approach to investigating fluid structure interactions of thousands of flexible     
1:23:42     
fibers we demonstrate the robust emergence and evolution of cell spanning vortices or twisters and     
1:23:49     
three-dimensional cellular geometries so now they're talking about you know how these things emerge and maintain     
1:23:57     
themselves and they the cell spanning vortices or Twisters so there are these     
1:24:02     
vortexes that exist within the cell and they go across the cell and they sort of     
1:24:07     
coordinate these streaming events and so they actually model the geometry of this in cells which is     
1:24:14     
important for really being specific about how these streams affect     
1:24:20     
morphogenesis these twister flows dominated by near rigid body rotation     
1:24:26     
with secondary tral components reproduce the variety of experimental observations     
1:24:31     
in cells these flows are probably involved in Rapid mixing and transport of op plasmic components so this is     
1:24:39     
something that you know is involved it sort of uh allows for transport within     
1:24:44     
the cytoplasm but also mixing of things within the cytoplasm so you can you know     
1:24:50     
the molecular motors have to move to different plac places in the cell to do their work and of course they need some     
1:24:55     
sort of highway to do that so the streaming uh mechanisms within the oite     
1:25:00     
of while for that uh you also have mixing so you sometimes need to have things well mixed you don't want things     
1:25:07     
segregated out as part of the you know different parts of the cell so you want to do that as     
1:25:14     
well uh so this is some this is an old concept cytoplasmic streaming uh this     
1:25:19     
was first described in 1774 by Bonaventure accorti who was I     
1:25:25     
guess an early microscopist of the cell regulates a wide range of intracellular     
1:25:31     
processes especially when large cell size makes diffusion and motor-driven transport too slow for efficient inello     
1:25:39     
or transport and mixing so if you have a cell you have things going on inside the     
1:25:45     
cell and you know they throughout the cytoplasm things are moving towards the from the nucleus to the a membrane and     
1:25:53     
from the membrane to the nucleus into other organel within the cell so you have all these transport imperatives and     
1:26:00     
so streaming allows you to coordinate these to make sure that things aren't compartmentalized or they don't cluster     
1:26:07     
in certain locations now when they talk about diffusion of course we've talked about that with respect to the cell one common     
1:26:15     
explanation is diffusion or brownie in motion and diffusion at least Brownie     
1:26:20     
and diffusion operates sort of locally where some particle or some thing it     
1:26:28     
could be a molecular motor motor explores the space around the common central point so the path I'm drawing     
1:26:36     
here is sort of the path around that point and as you can see it doesn't really do a very good job of     
1:26:41     
transporting things throughout the cell especially if the cell is large if you     
1:26:47     
have a lot of things you need to coordinate in a c you know in a directed manner so Brownie and motion is not a     
1:26:53     
good explanation but if you had flows or dominant flows that kind of     
1:27:01     
move things around like this mixing them or things moving outward and inward from     
1:27:07     
the nucleus that might be a better way to transport things you can combine that     
1:27:12     
then with Brownie and motion and get this sort of system where     
1:27:17     
you get this flow this dominant flow mode the streaming but then some very variation along that Stream So the     
1:27:24     
stream is kind of like you know has a little bit of a wiggle to it and it allows for changes to occur so this is     
1:27:31     
you know this is about transport but more importantly it's about efficient transport something that doesn't take     
1:27:37     
forever to eventually diffuse it to the edge of the cell and with Brony in motion you know you not only get this     
1:27:44     
just kind of blind exploration around a single point it sort of migrates you     
1:27:49     
know not necessarily directionally but in you know it it migrates directionally     
1:27:55     
to some extent but it's very slow and so that rate is too slow for a lot of the metabolic processes in the cell then the     
1:28:02     
question is how does this mechanism occur we know it's useful we know that     
1:28:07     
it can allow for circulating uh flow and and moving things efficiently and     
1:28:13     
quickly to certain destinations and it doesn't rely in this slow diffusion process but it has to be set up by some     
1:28:19     
mechanism and so cytoplasmic flows are commonly driven by forces originating from the cell cortex remoor proteins     
1:28:27     
carry cargo along cytoskeletal filaments and so and TR the     
1:28:32     
fluid so of course your cytoplasm is fluidic and you have something like this     
1:28:38     
or the cytoplasm is in in between these two lines and you have     
1:28:44     
filaments that sort of coordinate so you know the filament sort of order or     
1:28:49     
organize these flows to go between them or through uh a set of filaments and so you know     
1:28:56     
you might have something like this you might have something like this where coordinates the     
1:29:02     
movement the formation of macroscopic flows and cells requires an alignment in motor movements across many filaments in     
1:29:09     
some cells this alignment originates from the organization of acting filaments at earlier developmental     
1:29:14     
stages so acting filaments organizing themselves in different ways uh in this     
1:29:19     
case they're moving things with they're you know they have this act and filaments expand and contract and so     
1:29:27     
they act like little muscles moving things this model of algae they have     
1:29:32     
this uh sort of Developmental origin and it can uh provide a static boundary     
1:29:39     
condition for the flow problem and others like OS sites of the fruit foph which is one they're going to focus on     
1:29:45     
here uh Motors move on a cytoskeletal that of flexible microt tuves and their     
1:29:50     
alignment and direction were proposed to arise by means of self-amplifying feedback between motor induced     
1:29:56     
cytoplasmic flows and Collective deformations of the microtop EV so in this case we have this these flows that     
1:30:03     
are liquid and they're moving at a certain rate but then we also have these deformations of the microtubule bed so     
1:30:11     
this is my diagram of the filaments organizing themselves the microtubule bed might be something like this which     
1:30:18     
can be deformed so it can have some displacement and then you have the flows themselves which move against it and so     
1:30:25     
all these things interact to provide a mechanism for movement and a mechanism for facilitating     
1:30:32     
movement so the cytoplasm of the developing groph oite remains relatively     
1:30:38     
quiescent for the first three days of ogenesis so this is like very early development during this time diffusion     
1:30:46     
and directed transport so this is a combination of diffusion and directed transport so you have have diffusion on     
1:30:53     
one of these flows like we showed here and those things combine in a in a way that allows     
1:31:00     
molecular factors to localize and get to the place that they need to go for patterning so what we have basically is     
1:31:08     
a model where flows can disrupt sort of this compartmentalization but it can     
1:31:14     
also promote compartmentalization and pattern so this is a better sort of visualization of this than I was drawing     
1:31:21     
uh you have these nice animations here this is a stable substrate this is a beating substrate and this is a     
1:31:27     
streaming substrate so you can see that these filaments sort of are organized in     
1:31:33     
different ways so when it's stable they're all sort of uh aligned beating     
1:31:38     
is where they have this pattern it's kind of like one of those um air uh Dows     
1:31:44     
that they have where they kind of they push air up into it and it dances around     
1:31:50     
uh with the pulsating of the air so it's just beating it's not very coordinated     
1:31:55     
but it can you know move around it can move things but that's still kind of you know sort of a Kinder bronan motion it's     
1:32:02     
not really great for moving things directionally in the case of streaming these filaments bend in a certain     
1:32:08     
direction so over time there's this bending in in One Direction instead of like bending in various directions over     
1:32:15     
time and then of course in the stable case you get no bending it's it's laminer and so you get this uh streaming     
1:32:22     
is is of course the better option here so this shows uh where you have beating     
1:32:28     
streaming in a stable regime so you have this phase diagram that show these     
1:32:34     
different cases so beating is this part of the phase diagram stable is here and streaming is up here's another example     
1:32:40     
here of what these look like on the membrane of the cell so you have these     
1:32:46     
actin filaments that are onto the cortex and so you can see that they form this sort of light layer of uh filaments that     
1:32:54     
can facilitate streaming or impacted by streaming and sort of facilitate the     
1:32:59     
flows and so in this case here so this is case one and case two if we go back     
1:33:04     
up to the phase diagram case one is ining so this is where they're beating and they're moving around as you saw up     
1:33:10     
here in case two they're streaming so they're all coordinated and oriented in the same direction so you can see that     
1:33:17     
they might facilitate a flow that's operating with respect to streaming so     
1:33:22     
streaming is not just the fluid flow it's the orientation of the substrate as     
1:33:28     
well this shows an example here of case one and case two in time so this is a a     
1:33:33     
diagram that shows the flow and it shows the physics of the flow and so you get this much more coordinated     
1:33:40     
flow that goes around sort of in a circular manner so this actually shows     
1:33:45     
you um you know some of these properties some of the Dynamics going on in the     
1:33:50     
cell and then of course we can see examples of this uh this beating versus streaming     
1:33:57     
so this is beating this is streaming and of course the physics of it are much more ordered here then there the     
1:34:05     
Dynamics are much more ordered in the case of streaming than beating beating     
1:34:10     
provides these oscillations streaming provides this more linear State they need to model these things so we have     
1:34:16     
some nice animations here but they're going to do some computation modeling of dynamically coupled motor driven fibers     
1:34:24     
so conceptually plus n directed Motors here they use the kesan one uh molecule     
1:34:32     
bind along anchored microtubules so they're binding kesan one to these microtubules that are anchor to the     
1:34:38     
cortex so they call them plus end directed Motors meaning that there's an end that allows for the motor to direct     
1:34:44     
its U cargo so these these uh plus indirected motors which is a kesan one     
1:34:51     
and an anchored microt tuu combined together they carry a cargo towards free     
1:34:57     
plus ends and detaching once they reach there so they move things from one place to another using these the ends of the     
1:35:05     
microtubules uh although the cargos seem varied possibly inducing cellular organal and Yol granules free     
1:35:11     
microtubules have been identified as one cargo crucial for robust streaming so this kinesin one is a motor protein and     
1:35:18     
it moves along these microtubules uh and of course we need to be able to carry cargo and you know to     
1:35:26     
facilitate the streaming we have to have the right sort of molecules in place and     
1:35:31     
the right molecules doing the driving with this given the lack of data on the details of Pargo binding in payload     
1:35:38     
densities and sizes we did we know the mechanisms or they're proposing the mechanisms and we can use that in the     
1:35:44     
modeling but we don't necessarily know a lot about how different payloads operate how they're how efficient this mechanism     
1:35:52     
is and so forth so if you think about a highway with trucks on it carrying cargo     
1:35:57     
you know you might know that the Trucks ride on the highway and that they can deliver things from place to place but     
1:36:04     
you don't necessarily know how efficient it is for every kind of load that you might put in those     
1:36:11     
trucks so they can't necessarily use that for modeling but they can just assume a simple model and they they site     
1:36:18     
reference 24 here where they course the forces of plus n directed cargos and bom     
1:36:24     
microtubules to a uniform compressive Force density so that is directed along     
1:36:30     
the bound microtubule towards its anchored end an equal and opposite forces exerted on the surrounding fluid     
1:36:37     
the satisfying Newton's third law we find this is sufficient to recover many aspects of observed streaming and to     
1:36:43     
make several predictions so consider n microtubules clamped to the inner surface of a     
1:36:50     
spheroidal cell of effective radius R and surface area s     
1:36:55     
and so this is where we have again the inside of our     
1:37:06     
cell and so we have our cell here we have the cortex here with the     
1:37:12     
microtubules kind of lining this and so now according to the paper     
1:37:20     
we consider microtubules and clamp to the inner surface of a spal cell of effective     
1:37:27     
radius R surface area s so the surface area is this area     
1:37:36     
here and then R is the radius out to here so we need all these parameters to     
1:37:43     
model this so it's a Sol of a certain size of a certain radius there's a surface area so cells aren't usually     
1:37:49     
just sort of spherical they have you know different shapes and different variation there and then you have a     
1:37:56     
number of microtubules which you can count as n so the larger the surface area the more microtubules there are the     
1:38:03     
larger the radius the more microtubules there are and so forth this isn't necessarily going to uh     
1:38:10     
scale linearly but we can get a sense of what it should look like using these three     
1:38:15     
parameters microtubules are well models modeled as inextensible elastic SL under     
1:38:21     
bodies and so this is where we saw these little bar these little uh tubes up in     
1:38:27     
figure one where they were either like kind of twisting around in the wind as     
1:38:33     
it were in the in the flow or they were ending in a coordinated manner but they     
1:38:38     
have this sort of flexibility is this elasticity that allows them to bend and     
1:38:45     
move around but they're anchored at one end remember so they can't just move freely anywhere     
1:38:52     
uh and the cytoplasm is modeled as a Newtonian fluid of viscosity mu which is from reference 22 a shape of a micral i     
1:39:00     
at time T is given by x s t uh where the S is the arc length from the base and Li     
1:39:06     
I from its length so basically they're modeling the shape of the microtubule so this is where we have     
1:39:14     
here we have the microtubule which is anchored at one     
1:39:20     
end bending and it has physical properties     
1:39:25     
and then the force is here the flow is here and there's a force so this is a Newtonian     
1:39:31     
fluid which means it should respond linearly it's not a non- neonian fluid     
1:39:36     
which is nonlinear in its response and then this is the filament here which     
1:39:43     
is use several parameters to characterize the filament the shape is given by XIs the microtubule shape     
1:39:52     
Evolution caused by drag fores balancing elastic and motor forces given by its     
1:39:57     
local slender body Theory which is this term     
1:40:03     
here and so we can model this uh as a physics problem is this sort of uh this     
1:40:10     
this thing that's kind of facilitating the flow it's bending with respect to the flow and there's a transport that's     
1:40:16     
going to happen in the system so simulating the system     
1:40:22     
efficiently for thousands of microtubules has peculiar challenges the microtubules make the system geometry     
1:40:28     
very complex because you have this you know the surface isn't constant it has     
1:40:34     
you know bends in it and it has you know variations in the surface uh and so the microtubules line that surface and they     
1:40:41     
Bend sometimes they don't always bend in the same direction as we talked about so sometimes they're not always in line     
1:40:47     
with the streaming but they all have you know we have these dependent filaments uh you know and maybe they're     
1:40:54     
not uniform down the surface of the cortex so we have these     
1:40:59     
you know multiple filaments and sometimes they're align and sometimes they're not but this is     
1:41:06     
the challenge in modeling this sometimes the cortex is undulated sometimes it's a straight line uh so although the number     
1:41:13     
of degrees of freedom mainly discretized microt tual forces and shapes is not extreme so it's around the order of 10     
1:41:20     
the 5th or 10 the sixth which is manageable in a computational environment modern computational     
1:41:26     
environment all all are globally coupled by The Stokes equations and the system needs to be simulated for long times so     
1:41:33     
we have the Stokes equations which model the fluid dynamics and so we need to have this for this we developed a fast     
1:41:39     
and scalable computational platform that accurately evolves equations for this is     
1:41:45     
from citations one and two it has three main components so the first one is at     
1:41:50     
the B boundary integ integral integral representations in Slender body Theory     
1:41:55     
reduces the 3D Stokes equations in this complex domain to solving one-dimensional integral differential     
1:42:02     
equations of microtubules and a couple 2D integral equation on Cell surfaces of nearly     
1:42:09     
arbitrary geometry so they simulate a number of geometry cell cell surface     
1:42:15     
geometries they model uh you know they couple that with the micr tuia model and     
1:42:21     
they get their uh boundary conditions second to fast Stoke solver     
1:42:27     
efficiently evaluates the non-local hydrodynamic interactions between microtubules and the periphery with     
1:42:34     
linear scaling in the number of unknowns so again you have these different models modeling different components of this     
1:42:42     
relationship across different cell geometries so we can do this as a fact     
1:42:49     
fast dop solver and then third we use stable implicit explicit time stepping scheme to     
1:42:56     
efficiently evolve the stiff microt Tule Dynamics so the microtubules aren't just     
1:43:02     
of a constant stiffness they can have different a differential stiffness this allows us to have this streaming mode or     
1:43:11     
other types of uh States as well and so they characterize the streaming phase     
1:43:17     
and they characterize the Twister so the Twisters are Global phenomenal of or Consequences of the streaming     
1:43:23     
phase so henceforth we focus on the streaming phase uh which generates FL     
1:43:28     
similar to those typically observed in ug Genesis stage 10B and Beyond in this region we find that the initially     
1:43:35     
straight microtubules at first Bend IN seemingly random directions then     
1:43:40     
gradually they align into a ray of bent microtubules wrapping around an axis of symmetry which you can see here in G so     
1:43:48     
you can see this uh how this model begins you have uh you have this bending in     
1:43:55     
different directions like this and then you have this coordinated stream streaming which is enabled by     
1:44:02     
coordinated bending and you end up with this Vortex that's Global this emerging axis is sensitive to details of initial     
1:44:10     
data and microt tual patterning the associated streaming flow is nearly steady strongly vertical fills the cell     
1:44:18     
and has speeds around 100 nanometers per second given that the streaming flow is essentially vertical about an extended     
1:44:24     
axis we were refer to as a twister so this looks like a tornado basically     
1:44:30     
where it's all sort of organiz organized around a central point and that Central     
1:44:35     
Point then is sort of the center of gravity for this model but     
1:44:41     
it fills the entire cell so it's moving around in a coordinated manner moving     
1:44:46     
things around the cell from the center of the cell up to the uh out to the membrane and so the     
1:44:54     
cytoplasm has this sort of global it's almost like a a cell in     
1:45:00     
uh in the atmosphere where you have flow you know you have weather that transits     
1:45:07     
the Earth and they exist within these cells at certain latitudes and so you     
1:45:12     
can see this kind of effect happening here so there's a primary flow and a secondary flow so the secondary flow     
1:45:19     
consists of two two counter rotating toroidal vortices one in each hemisphere     
1:45:24     
wrapped around the Twister axis so this is like in again the climatological example where you have different cells     
1:45:31     
for different parts of the sphere or what is essentially hemispheres of a     
1:45:38     
cell so it doesn't necessarily need to be a sphere but it does need to it's going to have two hemispheres where     
1:45:44     
these counter rotating tral fores can occur the simulated streaming flows can     
1:45:50     
be well fit any away from the boundaries as a flow with surface slip by superposing a Pur 2D rotational flow     
1:45:58     
with an aligned axisymmetrical bidal bidal flow that satisfies the no slip condition so this     
1:46:06     
is just talking about the different aspects of the flow Dynamics and Twisters are a combination     
1:46:12     
of a strong vertical flow and a weak bidal flows you can see here you get     
1:46:18     
these strong vertical flows here and then bidal flows which are the     
1:46:24     
hemispheres so they do some live Imaging of cytoplasmic flows uh again here's a more modeling     
1:46:31     
where they show some of the Dynamics here of these different uh regimes of the     
1:46:36     
flow and then here's where they I think they do some live Imaging here so they're actually showing the orientation     
1:46:43     
in the oite once again returning to the modeling uh the structure of the streaming flow is robust so you can see     
1:46:49     
that there are these polarity vectors that occur within the cell and you can see some of the     
1:46:56     
Dynamics here so the microtubule configurations uh show cell geometry     
1:47:02     
similar to theop oite from an early and a late time point so the early time     
1:47:08     
point is I the weight time point is triple I so I is here this is an early     
1:47:13     
time point the weight time point is here and this shows the configurations of the     
1:47:18     
microtubules kind of they set up in the early in the late stage Twisters have a     
1:47:24     
robust emergence where they have these different emerging States and they can simulate this using different initial     
1:47:31     
conditions this show self organizing streaming to be very robust with the main variation being the orientation of     
1:47:37     
the Twister in the cell so taking together their results     
1:47:43     
underscore the robustness of cytoplasmic streaming that emerges from hydrodynamic interactions among cortically anchored     
1:47:49     
microtubules fine-tuning is not required you get a lot of robust Dynamics from this basic     
1:47:56     
uh type of organization self-organization takes care of organizing these cell spanning     
1:48:02     
Twisters so you get both Global Transport and this local secondary activity in the actual details of how     
1:48:10     
this the physics the mechanics how this work are secondary to sort of the boundary conditions and the Dynamics     
1:48:17     
that emerge from the initial condition uh naming such vortices Twisters begs     
1:48:23     
comparisons of the more familiar kind of Twister or tornado tornadoes are inertial dominated     
1:48:29     
and have highly localized V fortical cores maintain an axial swirl away from     
1:48:35     
which flow velocities Decay so from the center of the tornado you get these uh     
1:48:42     
highly stable vortices but then as you move outward from the center The Vortex     
1:48:49     
decays our zero Reynolds number Twisters of velocities rising from the center all     
1:48:54     
solid body rotation and reflect a precise balance between active surface driving and viscous dissipation so they     
1:49:03     
resemble U tornadoes up to a point self organized boundary div vortices have     
1:49:09     
risen and other active matter systems such as confined suspensions of swimming bacteria so that's citation 38 and so     
1:49:17     
this is not just something you see in OS sites you see that in bacterial colonies and how they're     
1:49:25     
suspended in confined spaces uh so this is you know something     
1:49:30     
again self-organization can kind of dictate if you give it the right boundary conditions in the right initial     
1:49:37     
conditions our model makes several interesting predictions uh first of all our twister     
1:49:43     
States our volumetric structures which predict that standard microscopy images show should show a variety of flows     
1:49:50     
depending on how the image volume intersects with the flow structure so if you can look into a cell at a certain     
1:49:56     
angle or look in you know in terms of where you are in the volume and where     
1:50:01     
you are in the flow structure that can give you the right information uh this is consistent with our own experimental     
1:50:07     
observations further our simulations are statistically uniform microt tual beds     
1:50:13     
and axis symmetrical cell shapes thus our Twisters have no preferred direction of rotation with respect to the axes of     
1:50:20     
cell symmetry so they don't necessarily match up with the sort of the structures     
1:50:25     
of the cell they just match up with how the microt tual is set up     
1:50:30     
flow uh our exper experimental reconstructions showed no evidence for rotational biases clockwise or     
1:50:38     
counterclockwise with respect to the anterior posterior cell axis and so this     
1:50:43     
is not something that is coordinated by the uh symmetrical structures of the     
1:50:48     
cell or the orientation the cell it's just simply something it's set up by uh     
1:50:54     
the microtubules and the flow our simulations of strong secondary     
1:51:01     
streaming flows originating from defect Center so if they defects in the layer of microtubules where there changes in     
1:51:09     
the shape of the cell that are defect you know defective in that sense then um     
1:51:15     
that can affect the uh streaming flow so although rotational flows seems very     
1:51:22     
robust these secondary flows may not be and they may be affected by various cellular and homogeneities so this is     
1:51:29     
again you know if you have a perfectly spherical cell you'll have a perfectly     
1:51:34     
uh stable secondary flow or rotational flow but if there variations in the cell     
1:51:40     
especially over time you can have instabilities arise very interestingly simulated     
1:51:47     
twisters and oite shapes shows slow orientation on the long to T time scale     
1:51:54     
towards the anterior posterior axis so this means that there's a reorientation towards the geometry and the symmetry of     
1:52:01     
the cell over time which is interesting and it may make sense because you know this gets aligned with the cell shape as     
1:52:08     
it moves around the Dynamics will sort of gravitate towards the path least     
1:52:15     
resistance the nature of these Dynamics also indicates the existence of a manifold twister State towards which the     
1:52:21     
system is rapidly attracted and on which Twisters slowly move towards axis alignment which we believe to be the     
1:52:28     
state of minimum energy so this again is about energy minimization over time this     
1:52:33     
picture is consistent with simulations in spheres where elastic energy also shows rapid peaking and then Decay and     
1:52:40     
of course you can have overshoot but when you align with the geometry of the cell the symmetry of the cell you can     
1:52:47     
limit that overshoot so twisters serve a number of functions before the onset of streaming diffusion in motor D and     
1:52:54     
transport are the main means by which different classes of rnas are transported and anchor to the anterior     
1:53:00     
dorsal and posterior regions of the osades so RNA transport is one function uh you can actually have uh     
1:53:09     
precocious streaming which is where things are just carried everywhere and you don't necessarily want that like I     
1:53:14     
said sometimes you want local uh fun compartmentalization but you don't want things to be locally compartmented just     
1:53:22     
by default you want that streaming to pick things up move them around but not just everywhere and so this is something     
1:53:29     
that can be present or prevented by these the Dynamics of these streams as well the streaming flow might be used to     
1:53:36     
efficiently disperse the arriving Yol throughout the Yol plasm the idea is consistent with the fact that Yol     
1:53:42     
proteins are known caros of kissan one Motors so again Canan one is known as a     
1:53:48     
transport mechanism for these y yolk proteins and so that matches what     
1:53:53     
we expect thank you for paying attention and I hope you learned something
