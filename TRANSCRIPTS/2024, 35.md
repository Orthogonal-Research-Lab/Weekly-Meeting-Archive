## TRANSCRIPT

0:03     
hello good morning I'm still here okay are you there     
0:10     
dick okay I guess he's there um I what blocked from audio I     
0:17     
don't know why oh it could be the browser again I don't know oh and     
0:25     
video not sure why that is so welcome to the media     
0:31     
um anyways any updates I guess uh dick you can put them in the     
0:37     
text in the     
0:43     
chat we get to believe at 10 okay     
0:51     
well yeah I might uh what I might do today is uh go over a few papers and     
0:58     
see uh what is in them uh I have a couple things that I'd like to talk     
1:07     
about so the first paper is this paper on uh C elan's egg Ling     
1:15     
circuits and that we have natural variation in these circuits and there's this     
1:21     
intergenerational Fitness tradeoff that you see in these different uh EG blings     
1:30     
circuits so of course seans lays eggs um they're hermaphrodites they fertilize     
1:35     
their own eggs they lay probably 200 eggs per life cycle so you have a seans     
1:42     
that'll weigh about 200 eggs now there's a small proportion of males where you know we get basically a small proportion     
1:51     
of the population that can become males they have male reproductive organs and     
1:57     
they actually can uh outcross from you know with with     
2:03     
hermaphrodites and they seans does that nature to sort of replenish the gene     
2:10     
pool so they do this in times of stress and times uh other times during their     
2:16     
life cycle so but most seans or hermaphrodites they lay eggs and they     
2:22     
lay about 200 or so eggs and you know they have to have this they have this     
2:27     
eggling circuit that's a I guess a behavior circuit and this mediates a lot of the     
2:33     
fitness uh that you see in C elans and so that's that's what this paper is     
2:40     
about so let me go through the P the abstract um so uh the abstract reads evolutionary     
2:49     
transitions from ovap parity to Viva parity are frequent across diverse taxa     
2:56     
some species also display intraspecific variation in par it mode where they     
3:01     
exhibit an intermediate mode by laying eggs containing embryos at variable     
3:06     
often Advanced stages of development so this is where um you know this is just     
3:14     
kind of describing the variation in eggling across different Taxas so of     
3:20     
course ovap parity is where you have eggling of a parity is where you have     
3:25     
this live birth uh and so you have this uh you know uh sort of this transition     
3:33     
you have this intermediate mode where you have some embryo and an egg that is     
3:40     
uh advanced in terms of its development so that's you know this isn't specific     
3:46     
to se allans is specific to the Tree of Life how such natural quantitative     
3:52     
variation and egg retention arises through differences in genetics behavior and Physiology and how this variation     
3:59     
ultimately connects to variation in specific Fitness components is not well understood so basically they're     
4:07     
interested in this sort of variation in egg laying and and different     
4:13     
developmental strategies uh in terms of its genetics behavior and Physiology uh and then of course this     
4:20     
connects to Fitness components because this is sort of at the heart of reproduction so you can't reproduce if     
4:27     
you don't produce live birds or live replicants I guess uh so this is the     
4:34     
sort of framing the problem here we study this problem by characterizing intraspecific variation constitutive     
4:42     
retention of fertilized eggs of the nematodes caner htis elements analyzing     
4:47     
a panel of about 300 wild strains so they you know these are wild type strains that they found they want to get     
4:54     
the natural variation so uh you know just going to the Define mutants may not     
5:00     
help you because they have sometimes they have specific mutations for different um you know mutations that     
5:09     
affect egg Ling we don't want to really look at that variation we want to look at natural     
5:15     
variation so analyzing this panel we find very highly variable intrauterine     
5:20     
retention of fertilized eggs with a fraction of strain showing either strongly reduced or increased egg renion     
5:28     
with partial viviparity uh we provide evidence for multiple evolutionary origins of such phenotypic     
5:35     
extremes and we identify candidate Loi explaining this natural     
5:41     
variation so they have this um you know some of the strains a small number will show this     
5:49     
sort of uh partial viviparity where there's this they retain the eggs until     
5:55     
the embryos are to a certain stage and they'll drop the eggs or or they'll     
6:02     
uh you know not they'll drop their eggs right away so this is there's a lot of     
6:07     
variation here we provide evidence for multiple evolutionary origins of such phenotypic extremes and we identify     
6:15     
candidate Loi explaining this natural variation so they're able to Target the mutations responsible for this variation     
6:23     
and of course the idea being that if those Loi are selected then you end up with a change     
6:31     
in eggling strategy overall and if you know the individuals carrying those uh     
6:39     
those aels those genes uh end up forming a new species then that new species will have that strategy it's end of the     
6:48     
idea uh characterizing a subset of wild strains we confirm that natural     
6:53     
variation and eggling behavior contributes to observe differences in egg retention using multiple neurom     
6:59     
modulatory agents and control crisper cas9 mediated genetic     
7:04     
manipulation of endogenous serotonin levels and 10 wild strains so this is uh     
7:10     
where they're kind of looking at the neuro reproductive aspects which is an     
7:16     
interesting thing in se alans you can do this you can look at sort of how the brain controls certain physiological     
7:24     
functions and then look at its almost you can do experimental Evolution on     
7:29     
Elegance quite easily uh so you can actually look at the evolution of this sort of neurophysiological control and     
7:37     
it's it's really kind of a unique system for this because you can't see this saying humans     
7:43     
um so okay uh so the they look at using     
7:50     
multiple neuromodulatory agents and controll crisper C9 mediate a genetic     
7:56     
manipulation of endogenous serotonin levels in t Wild strain so they're using crisper cast     
8:01     
Stein um we show we then show that this behavioral variation arises through an     
8:07     
evolutionary Divergent neuromodulatory architecture of the anling circuitry intraspecific variation in     
8:14     
celan's neural circuit activity therefore connects A variation in reproductive strategy including     
8:20     
transitions from ovap parity to partial VI parity in a second objective we ask     
8:26     
why natural variation in celegans egg retention might might be maintained     
8:31     
examining potential Fitness costs and benefits of this natural variation we show that strong egg retention reduces     
8:37     
maternal fertility and survival mostly due to detrimental Lal hatching and     
8:43     
uterum so this is interesting because you know we we I just mentioned that we     
8:50     
can do the sort of experimental evolution in seans we can look at like you know we can maybe put some of these     
8:58     
uh strains under selection and we can you know passage the most fit     
9:03     
individuals but you still have this sort of you know in in nature you're going to have selection for some of these     
9:09     
strategies and so it's really interesting how you know these going to play out um and of course you know there     
9:17     
there are certain costs and benefits to different strategies so for example if     
9:22     
you have larel hatching in utero then that's you know and sometimes that's     
9:28     
beneficial and some times it's not so this is     
9:33     
um or actually uh actually when you have this egg     
9:39     
retention so the eggs can be retained over time and you know sometimes they     
9:46     
drop them later sometimes they drop them earlier and the idea here is that if they hold them too long they end up the     
9:54     
eggs end up hatching and you get these larvae inside the uh worm     
9:59     
and I don't know like there's this phenomenon in seans called bag of worms     
10:04     
where you have the seans the adult seans that's laying eggs and there's this huge     
10:11     
bag of worms that sort of forms inside the uh worm and of course the adult worm     
10:16     
dies and there these little worms inside that may be what's what you know that may be what's responsible for bag of     
10:23     
worms I'm not really sure but um this is one kind of problem with the Str     
10:29     
strategy is that if they wait too late to drop their eggs they end up with this     
10:34     
uh this detrimental thing so it's just kind of showing how natural variation     
10:40     
can kind of range from like the beneficial to the dilus to the lethal     
10:46     
this is kind of an interesting demonstration of it okay um on the other hand such     
10:54     
genotypes as strong egg retention can benefit from improved Offspring protection again against environmental     
11:01     
insults uh so you have when you have strong egg retention and you don't have this laral hatching if you have this     
11:09     
strategy of successful late dropping of eggs it can uh you know improve the     
11:15     
protection of the eggs so the eggs are out the environment as long so they can surv more of them can survive they don't     
11:22     
get Expos of the environment as much and they gain a competitive Advantage as The Offspring exhibit is shortened     
11:29     
uh extra uterine uh developmental time to reproductive maturity uh observe natural variation in     
11:36     
SE and Z waying Behavior May therefore reflect modifications of a tradeoff between     
11:43     
alternative Fitness components expressed across Generations so this is this idea of     
11:51     
tradeoffs and it's kind of an interesting way to view natural     
11:57     
selection in that you know you have these tradeoffs so when you talk about Fitness being high or Fitness being low     
12:04     
it's not usually just one factor so you know I could have a high     
12:10     
Fitness um in a certain environment and a low Fitness in another environment so     
12:15     
if the environment V is variable I have I'm I'm selecting for some trait where I     
12:21     
have a high Fitness in one instance of my existence when I'm in one environment     
12:29     
and then the environment shifts and all of the sudden I'm not a very fit     
12:34     
individual those dilar is traits or what's being selected against or for or     
12:40     
against and I suffer in terms of Fitness so you know you can have populations     
12:46     
that evolve like that where you know a population might have a high Fitness then a low Fitness then a high Fitness     
12:52     
and a low Fitness and so you might ask you know how does evolution proceed if that's the     
12:58     
case and the answer is is of course they're not just one trait there many traits     
13:04     
across the organism where they're all being kind of pulled in different directions because     
13:09     
they all have a certain Fitness the environment keeps changing and everything else and so there's this idea     
13:16     
of tradeoffs in other words like in in organisms when they face this problem of     
13:22     
this these Mosaic effects of evolution Mosaic effects of natural selection they will typically uh choose     
13:29     
a strategy that will be a tradeoff basically sometimes you know they can     
13:34     
have they pick a strategy that allows gives them a fitness benefit a marginal Fitness benefit with some other things     
13:42     
that they can't take advantage of if they you know were to say shift shift to another strategy so there are all these     
13:49     
trade-offs and and looking at um you know evolution in terms of tradeoffs it's a it's a literature it's     
13:56     
not very welldeveloped there there's a lot of room there I think for people to think about uh to do theory development     
14:02     
on some of what some of these trade-offs are and how they the sort of The evolutionary dynamics of these     
14:08     
trade-offs so if you have like say for example multiple traits you know how do you benefit how     
14:15     
does your how do you maximize your overall Fitness and so that's where you     
14:21     
get this you know where organisms will pursue a certain strategy uh that ends     
14:26     
up giving him this marginal fitness advantage and giving them this ability to survive     
14:33     
overall so that's what they're talking about when they talk about tradeoffs um our study uncovers     
14:40     
unappreciated natural diversity in the SE allans eggling circuit and provides     
14:45     
insights into the fitness consequences of this behavioral variation we propose that intraspecific     
14:53     
variation and nematode eggling behavior and serve as an ideal system to Pino     
14:59     
point the molecular changes underlying evolutionary transitions between     
15:04     
invertebrate OVA and Viva parity so this is interesting uh work you know kind of     
15:10     
gives us a lot of food for thought in terms of both natural variation and     
15:17     
celegans which we don't talk about enough and this sort of these     
15:23     
tradeoffs uh that exist in natural populations     
15:33     
so this is uh see if there are any figures in     
15:40     
here so this kind of shows the different wild strains that they have uh collected     
15:47     
here there are 316 wild strains uh they have different classes here where they     
15:53     
have the number of eggs in utero so these are different classes of wild strings     
15:59     
that have different numbers of eggs in utero so this is where you have class     
16:05     
one where there are less than 10 eggs in utero class two where they have 10 to 25 eggs in utero and class three which is     
16:12     
over 25 eggs in utero you can see that they've made these selections so that they have the sort of small medium and     
16:19     
large number of eggs and they can count which easily which     
16:25     
ones are you know which ones you have so you have uh 81% of Class 2 15% of class     
16:34     
1 and 4% of class three so that's uh kind of what they're looking at here and     
16:40     
this is the distribution of that uh there's a geographic distribution of these so class three was     
16:49     
I think was restricted to Europe uh Class 2 was you know worldwide     
16:54     
and then or I guess in North America and North Africa in Europe maybe which is a     
17:00     
good way to describe and then their class two because it consisted of most of their sample here is throughout the     
17:07     
world it's worldwide and so you can see that you know seans is found all over the world     
17:13     
you find wild strings in every part of the world but that variation is     
17:19     
sometimes geographically clustered sometimes uh well for class two that     
17:25     
seems to be the worldwide distribution uh so they're looking at the mean number     
17:31     
of eggs in utero uh this is where they look at the different The genome and they look at     
17:38     
they do this genome scan where they look at um this they have this plot where     
17:45     
it's I guess not really sure what let's see what D     
17:52     
is uh Manhattan plots of single marker based gwa mappings so they do this     
17:58     
genome scan where they look for uh different lowside that might be involved     
18:04     
with egg laying and variation in egg laying and uh the log the sort of the     
18:10     
log P measure is the I guess it's the     
18:15     
association between the site that they're looking at and the eggling     
18:21     
behavioral trait so you have the seelan genome from one to five chromosomes one     
18:27     
to five and then the X chromosome which is um you know the way the G     
18:34     
Sean's uh genome is structured you have the data here and     
18:41     
then f is neighbor joining tree based on two     
18:47     
megabase regions surrounding the KC uh kcn L1 genomic region using a subset of     
18:53     
48 C with wild strings so this is where you have these     
18:59     
wild strains here you have this K CNL Gene K cnl1 and they're just looking at     
19:07     
this neighbor joining tree to see which ones are the most will say related so these     
19:13     
strains here um I guess these strains in     
19:18     
red have this kcn Gene and these others uh don't and there's just     
19:25     
obviously those are closely related so that's that's what this     
19:30     
is um yeah so they kind of go through their     
19:37     
work here they they show kind of some of     
19:43     
these strategies here they show Ade per animal uh in these different     
19:49     
classes and they kind of show like over this period so it's like 0 to     
19:55     
30 and then you have active and inactive and active phases so you have these     
20:02     
rounds of egling active inactive     
20:07     
active and this shows kind of see you     
20:14     
have natural variation in temporal patterns of egling behavior     
20:19     
temporal tracking of eggling phase and individual hermaphrodites uh where they look at     
20:25     
they're looking at this midl four St laral stage plus 30 hours so that's early     
20:30     
adulthood um so they're looking over a 3-hour interval so they're looking at     
20:36     
these different strains they're looking at they're eggling over this interval and they kind of have these you know as     
20:43     
I said they're these active and inactive periods so this is sort of the distribution of egg ling you're able to     
20:49     
like look at it and see when the eggs are laid so the the Takeo message of this is that they're able to say first     
20:56     
of all divide up class three into different different pieces have class one and class two you have some select     
21:02     
strains and the pattern is often very different it's almost kind of stochastic um with some actually some in     
21:10     
some cases you get these kind of paired eggling events followed by a larger interval of inactivity then paradig L     
21:18     
events and then triplets and then sometimes you have these singular uh egg laying events     
21:25     
separated by a long period of inactivity so this is uh kind of just showing the     
21:31     
natural variation there's nothing special about these patterns except to say that they vary there doesn't seem to     
21:38     
be kind of a a market difference between class one class two and class     
21:43     
three except that you have strings within them that show different     
21:53     
patterns so the ACT way show here uh this is a nice kind of example of the     
21:59     
neural or I guess the neurophysiology of eggling so you have     
22:05     
uh the eggling active state in a it shows the head neuron     
22:12     
HSN this VC which is eoline inhibited     
22:18     
and then you have this uh uv1 you have vm1 and vm2 vm1 and vm2 are     
22:23     
mechanical neurons uh there's these interactions with VC and HSN     
22:29     
and this triggers egg releasee in uv1 um in the inactive State you have     
22:34     
this egg accumulation so it shuts down the circuit bm2 their Gap Junction and it so you     
22:43     
have this active state where all of these neurons are active in this inactive state where vm2 is inhibited     
22:49     
and it inhibits egg release specifically uv1 then can feed back to     
22:54     
HSN through egg release to tell it you know that we want to enter another active state or we end up act entering     
23:02     
an inactive state so that's how that circuit is set up um and then this is another diagram     
23:10     
of the eggling active state where you have this drug treatment um and it kind     
23:15     
of shows how this is mediated and then this is showing the     
23:22     
exid for animal this is uh the different classes so these are the strains we saw     
23:27     
where we saw the pattern of active and inactive egling we saw we see uh these     
23:33     
different drug treatments I guess um and and the effects of that so you have     
23:39     
serotonin uh and then some of these other drug treatments and they're going to show the differences here so this     
23:47     
is c d uh so natural variation in egang in     
23:53     
response to exogenous serotonin floatin and inamine so these are exogenously     
24:00     
applied um drugs in a neurotransmitter adult     
24:05     
hermaphrodites uh again that midal for stage plus 30 hours were replaced an M9     
24:11     
buffer which is this buffer which you know is a sort of a neutral liquid     
24:16     
without food or an M9 containing the indicated concentrations of these uh treatments     
24:23     
the number of exela were scored after two hours assays for each of the three treatments are cared     
24:29     
independently the 15 screens were scored in parallel over the control which is in     
24:35     
buffer and the treatment which is uh the uh buffer plus the the uh     
24:43     
treatment for uh for each of these three essays so that's basically showing this     
24:49     
kind of effect of these different exogenously applied um things so this is just showing the V     
24:57     
again the variation um in eggling across these different     
25:03     
strains given these treatments or the control so this is uh you know this is     
25:09     
something if you want to look at it and maybe you'll find some interesting     
25:27     
patterns so this is an interesting paper um basically what they did here was they     
25:33     
found that one celegans exhibits quantitative variation and egg retension     
25:38     
with rare instances of extreme phenotypes at either end of the spectrum two both common and rare genetic     
25:44     
variance underly observe phenotypic variation three strain differences in egg retention can be larg way explained     
25:51     
by differences in eggling Behavior such as the onset of IG activity and the timing of the Rhythm between active and     
25:58     
inactive vaping phases or these behavioral differences map at least partially to genetic     
26:05     
differences in the sensitivity to various neuromodulators indicative of natural     
26:10     
variation in seigan egling circuitry five modifying eggling Behavior causing strong egg retention     
26:17     
link to frequent laral hatching in utero negatively impacts maternal Fitness and     
26:23     
then six prolong but six prolonged intrauterine embryonic develop     
26:29     
May benefit Offspring by improving their competitive ability and protection against environmental insults so this is     
26:36     
where we have this tradeoff between some of these things uh some of these     
26:41     
drawbacks to late eggling and some of these benefits to leg late egg Ling and     
26:47     
you can tell you know you also have the same thing with early egg Ling there are benefits and drawbacks and the question     
26:54     
is is given the environment that the vers find themselves in uh you know can they benefit from so     
27:01     
that's basically the the U the lesson here and of course then we     
27:07     
can look at some of these VAR genetic variants and how they affect this egg langang circuit and this egg Wang     
27:14     
circuit really drives you know it's both sort of how the egg Wang circuit is modulated but     
27:21     
also you know the eggling circuits Dynamics given different genetic variance uh given different uh     
27:29     
environmental settings what those are so it's it's a nice combination of things     
27:35     
where you have the neurom modulatory aspect the genomic aspect and sort of     
27:42     
the experimental Evolution aspect of the fitness tradeoffs so that's it's good paper it's     
27:50     
uh we don't talk about uh celan's natural variation enough and you know     
27:56     
it's an important thing because you know it's like we talk about seans being this almost like this     
28:04     
machine and it's not really machine it's very very fascinating system on its own     
28:10     
its own biology so so any questions about     
28:19     
that okay so yeah dick said not detrimental the baby worms yeah well I     
28:25     
don't know if they it's oh you talking about the bag of worms well if they get stuck in the adult worm they don't     
28:31     
survive either they you know they don't have anything to eat I guess anyways     
28:37     
um might account for multiple phenotypes of singled cell organisms yeah yeah it's     
28:44     
probably the case they're alive bearing sharks as babies eat one another in     
28:49     
utero number is not constant yes that's it's     
28:55     
interesting um good old shirt     
29:02     
okay well if there are questions on that the next uh item is this it's more of a     
29:08     
popular article on eoli intelligence or you know actually they're focused on     
29:13     
chemotaxis which is this Behavior you see in celegans as well where these uh     
29:19     
there's this sensory imperative to find the seans or the the eoli need to find     
29:25     
their way to a food source of some type so these chemical gradients in the environment and the idea is they have to     
29:32     
find their way to the sort of source of the gradient so seans they're usually looking for bacteria and in eoli they're     
29:39     
looking for different chemicals but it's the same kind of principle where they're     
29:45     
searching as chemical gradient they might start at the edge of it where the chemical is weak but they you know they     
29:51     
explore the space around it so you find the place where that weak signal     
29:56     
strengthens and and then you follow that until you get to the strongest signal so     
30:02     
they call this chemotaxis of course and they kind of reflect on this in this     
30:08     
article so this is the baffling intelligence of a single cell this is actually I think a substack post from     
30:15     
James suers who a science writ so this is the story of eoli     
30:21     
chemotaxis so uh you know this is really about how     
30:26     
single cell organisms and of course seans which is not a single cell organism but nevertheless     
30:33     
they also have to forge for nutrients so you know they seans has     
30:38     
like this chemo sensation uh ability they have neurons that sense different     
30:44     
chemicals and so they can do this just as well as Sean or eoli eoli of course     
30:50     
has different Pathways for doing this so uh this process known as     
30:56     
chemotaxis means uh well chemotaxis can be broken     
31:02     
up into chemo for chemical and taxis for the Greek word or tactics which is     
31:09     
basically how you you know the things you do to achieve something uh so this     
31:15     
is basically intelligence in one of its most Elemental forms an individual eoli     
31:21     
has no brain obviously is even many orders of magnitude simpler than a human cell it only already possesses something     
31:29     
like a sense of smell dve of even a memory so this is of course you know it     
31:35     
isn't the same thing as like you know animal senses um usually like you know     
31:41     
sensing things in the environment different types of chemical or different types of chemical transduction Pathways     
31:49     
that allow it to you know kind of sense magnitudes of things so this is kind of     
31:54     
almost like a a py physics uh where they can sense you know     
32:01     
detect differences in things or uh the magnitude of things Rel to something     
32:07     
else so chemotaxis recast Eola is not some aimless gut pest but rather as an     
32:13     
explicitely sophisticated physical computer and for that it provideed a     
32:19     
link to U this wetwear book which is     
32:28     
a book by Dennis Bray which is uh wetwear computer in every living     
32:34     
cell and kind of you know he kind of selling it as this in the tradition of     
32:40     
irn sheringer what is life and Richard Dawkins a selfish jeene I I've seen this book around I don't know if it's like     
32:47     
kind of in that sort of uh ground uh groundbreaking cast but it this is um     
32:55     
something that you know if you're interested in like sort of natural computation especially in single cells     
33:01     
this is a good book to at least check out I'm also telling the story because I     
33:08     
never liked the way biology was taught in high school it's in high school biology you're doing a lot of memory and     
33:14     
this is not that um hot taxis has a great slice it's     
33:20     
a Triumph of systems biology we understand it holistically but also in fine detail at almost every level it     
33:26     
acquaints you with many of the the most important motifs in biology including the way in which protein structure     
33:32     
determines function how membranes control the information flow into cells and how chemical modifications store and     
33:39     
communicate state so this is where we have uh this you know if we're talking     
33:44     
about natural computation we need to have some way to store State we need to     
33:50     
have some information flow and we need to have some functional aspects to you     
33:55     
know we need actually we also need to have you know like logic gates and things like that but uh I guess the     
34:01     
things kind of emerge from what we're talking about here um it involves one of the most     
34:07     
sophisticated and beautiful pieces of molecular nanotechnology the flood gel or motor so this is where you this is a     
34:15     
simulation on the right I don't know if you can see it it's on a black background but it's basically this     
34:21     
little agent which is a a triangle it's kind of moving around this uh concentric     
34:28     
Circle which is represented of this chemical gradient you see the little agent moving around the space through     
34:36     
the concentric circles but ultimately orbiting the center of the concentric circles kind of focusing its movements     
34:44     
on those areas and it's doing this sort of uh random walk it's probably     
34:50     
something like what we call Levy flight which is a 1 over F uh random walk and     
34:57     
it's kind of trying to find the source of this chemical but it doesn't have you     
35:03     
know like you can't see it in the distance it can only sense very locally     
35:08     
what the chemical is what the chemical concentration is but what it can do is it travels as it can sort of get     
35:16     
information about the chemical concentration at every point in space     
35:21     
and then integrate that spatially across different sites so as it travels in this     
35:26     
line that you see now it's kind of integrating over that that line and then it changes Direction at     
35:34     
every so often we're kind of like makes this wiggle and it changes Direction so     
35:39     
it's making these passes through a space and it's integrating information across     
35:45     
the different lines and it's able to sort of I guess more often than not find the source of     
35:52     
the food so it's an effective strategy um and it you know it seems like you're well you're actually are doing a random     
35:58     
walk you're just doing it in a way that is and you also have this ability to     
36:03     
transduce chemical information you're doing in a way that allows you to kind of find things by kind of more or less     
36:12     
through random motion um so the basic idea is this the     
36:17     
eoli smells chemicals it's attracted to with a set of receptors and decides how     
36:23     
to swim depending on what its sense is it can either use its Fel or tails swim     
36:28     
forward like a run like we see now or it can spin in a random direction or a     
36:34     
tumble so it can run or tumble it runs for a while then tumbles and it changes Direction and does another run so these     
36:41     
tumbles and runs are put together uh to to sort of explore the space by running     
36:48     
when the getting is good and tumbling when it isn't the coli takes a Meandering path towards the     
36:54     
attractant and so this is largely dependent on the Feller motor and the Feller tail since that's what     
37:01     
facilitates equalized movement and so this is where these rotors then are     
37:08     
controlled by you know chemical pathway so you know you have to think about like     
37:14     
seans egging seans has a brain so this is a neuro physiological process and     
37:21     
eoli this is you know where we have the Feller Motors and then we have some not     
37:26     
a brain but that's some sort of chemical pathway that's involved or some sort of gene expression pathway that's involved     
37:34     
in in controlling sort of this or you know feedback between this the chemical     
37:40     
sensation and this rotor so there's this same kind of system except it doesn't     
37:46     
involve a brain but it has a similar effect it basically uh uses the     
37:53     
environmental input as sort of a feedback mechanism to control the behavior     
37:58     
of so in a uniform chemical environment the ecoi swims in a random walk by     
38:04     
balancing runs of periodic tumbles so this is interesting like when     
38:09     
people model like random walks they just assume a stochastic     
38:14     
process and then when you model something like a levy flight you might assume a 1 over F distribution so it's     
38:22     
not a random process per se it's it's one over F randomness     
38:27     
um but in this case you know you might think well maybe it isn't random maybe     
38:33     
there is this structure to it that's uh maybe you know it starts off random but it becomes more sort of in tune with the     
38:41     
structure of the environment that is like these uh these chemical gradients     
38:47     
that you see here you know we draw them as sort of these perfect circles but that's often not the way they diffuse I     
38:54     
mean this is a theoretical pattern of chemical diffusion where you have a source at the middle and then it     
39:00     
degrades as you go outward so it decays and then finally becomes undetectable     
39:07     
now a lot of chemical gradients aren't necessarily in that sort of strictly     
39:12     
concentric circle pattern so there is some natural structure even if there you     
39:18     
know even if it was this sort of uh set of concentric circles this agent would     
39:24     
its Explorations would basically give it this l landscape of you know these different sort of irregularities in the     
39:33     
in the environment so you'd have places where along one of these runs where there's no chemical and then you have     
39:39     
places where there's a little bit of chemical and more chemical and it's basically you know able to integrate all     
39:47     
that information and detect these like variations in space so you have this     
39:53     
time component which is this run and you have you know each point in time there's     
39:58     
a sample being drawn and then there's some sort of concentration of chemical     
40:03     
and the integration of that is over space so when you move over time you're actually moving over space and that     
40:10     
chemical gradient is changing so the spatial distribution is changing but it's not a uniform change you can be in     
40:17     
different points in space and encounter different amounts of chemical the seans     
40:22     
basically has to not only find the immediate next point space and the     
40:28     
immediately higher concentration but has to sort of map out this entire diffusion     
40:35     
pattern and so or maybe enough of it to get a sense of where the center is so     
40:41     
that requires maybe some memory requires definitely some sensory input and some     
40:47     
integration of sensory information so it's really interesting how this and     
40:53     
then all that has to be sort of fed back to the motor so it can controlled     
40:58     
movement so yeah you know this this idea of exploitation and exploration is of     
41:05     
course this trade-off that we talked about the celegans where you know if you spend too much time exploring you know     
41:12     
you might explore in a space that's maybe not very fruitful if you spend too     
41:19     
much time tumbling and moving in changing direction you might miss mapping out some pattern so this is     
41:26     
where you have to balance these two activities and balance how you know that     
41:32     
of course the tumbles lead to the the eoli changing direction so it's kind of like searching for you know if you drop     
41:39     
your keys in a dark room and you want to find them and you have no idea where they are you have to have a develop a     
41:45     
strategy for finding them you also have a tradeoff you know do you search in one     
41:51     
side of the room or the other side of the room do you you know if you are kind of almost certain that you you drop them     
41:57     
on one side of the room you might spend all your time looking on that side of the room uh but that also precludes the     
42:04     
possibility that your keys are extra on the other side of it so they these tradeoffs in terms of search search     
42:10     
strategy you know how much time to devote to tumbling and running and you know some of the other     
42:17     
things that actually you know are very similar to what we were talking about was seel and     
42:24     
zle so in in fact in in in the case of ecoi this balance is achieved through a     
42:30     
single signaling molecule kiy uh kiy is constantly bouncing around     
42:36     
in the cytoplasm of eoli interacting with both the receptor complex which is the nose which is on     
42:42     
the uh surface of the cell and then the rotors which are of course not at the     
42:48     
same place as the receptor complex KY uh translates information between them     
42:57     
in the steady state when kiy encounters the receptor complex it gets chemically modified phosphorilated at a certain     
43:05     
rate to become ky- P so it's this phosphorilation stuff unlike the     
43:11     
unmodified version ky- p is a strong affinity for the rotors when enough     
43:17     
copies bind a one it reverses its spin cuses tumble so this is where you know     
43:23     
again you have this secondary process within the agent itself within the eoli     
43:31     
which is this molecule kyy it goes between the sensor and Factor     
43:37     
essentially between the Surface receptor complex and the     
43:42     
rotors and it basically accumulates at a certain rate becomes phosphorilated and if you have enough     
43:49     
copies that are phosphorilated uh you know we have this signal so it's kind of an interesting     
43:56     
way you know where it's this chem chemical signaling pathway that occurs     
44:01     
in a lot of cells but the way it's used is almost like kind of like a very simple brain or simple connectum um     
44:10     
there are lot of interesting parallels between this and brenberg vehicles because brenberg Vehicles use this     
44:17     
mapping between sensor and receptor and it's just you know kind of in     
44:22     
Greenberg's work it's kind of this theoretical connection and we assume that there's a connected in between and     
44:27     
indeed in a lot of organisms there is a small connecto at least between them a set of connections between maybe     
44:35     
interneurons and the sensor and effector now in this case you have actually molecules that are doing this playing     
44:42     
this role where they're modified and you know so there's this signaling that goes on and it's analogous to this sort of     
44:49     
very simple connect connection between sensor and effector um the trick is that when the     
44:56     
nose detect where that the surface receptor detects an increase in the concentration of attractant that steady     
45:02     
turning of kyy into key- PS is interrupted so when you get     
45:09     
an increase in the concentration of attractant you uh kind of favor     
45:16     
exploration versus this sort of uh tumbling so you want to favor continuing     
45:23     
the Run instead of going into the tumble so this uh steady state of turning keyys     
45:31     
into KY y- PS is interrupted so the phosphorilated versions of kyy are not     
45:37     
produced and it doesn't bind to the receptor uh of or it doesn't bind to the     
45:43     
rotor and so that's where we get this uh you know we basically tumble the ability     
45:49     
to Tumbl tumbling is shut off so as a result fewer ky- PS bind to the rotors     
45:56     
fewer take place and so the ecoi runs more and tumbles less in other words the     
46:02     
all important relative rate of runs versus Tumbl is determined entirely by     
46:07     
how often kyy to kyp churns and this in turn determines how much attractant is     
46:14     
detected by the nose so this almost suggests that we're setting up a set of differential equations here where we     
46:20     
have uh these relative rates of runs and tumbles these relative rates of key Y     
46:27     
and key y-p you can see this process and action in the interactive illustration here so     
46:34     
you see that like uh you know you have the key y-p which is in White and the     
46:41     
key Y which is in Blue uh I guess you could alter this by adding some     
46:47     
attractant in pink sure oh okay you can do this through this slider     
46:55     
maybe see okay I have the slider here I'm     
47:00     
controlling it so you can see that the pink is here and you have this white     
47:05     
which is the key Y and then the kyy p is the blue so it's     
47:11     
going from white to Blue and it's actually moving around the cell bouncing around the cytoplasm it looks like it's     
47:18     
stochastic the white the key Y is originating at the front of the uh cell     
47:24     
which is the um you know where the the receptor complex is and then the blue is     
47:30     
kind of being it's transformed it's phosphorated in the middle of the cell and it's transforming into this blue and     
47:37     
the blue are binding to the site down at the rotor which is some white are also     
47:43     
binding to the rotor so that's also kind of occupying that spot it's contributing     
47:49     
to a run when the blue is binding to the rotor it's contributing to a     
47:54     
tumble and you can see the the Feller uh you know the flagellum just kind of     
48:01     
moving in different ways so if I want to put more attractant in let's see if I can     
48:08     
do keep adding in this this pink which is the attractant now it's all phosphorated so     
48:16     
it doesn't show any un phosphorated keyw and so now it's kind of in     
48:22     
this uh okay so when we have yeah now we have I guess     
48:30     
I got to the point where it's all phosphorated and there you go so it's     
48:36     
showing these Dynamics within the cell so this is a nice simulation uh kind of showing this how     
48:43     
this works and so as they say here uh it     
48:50     
alter try altering the ratio of ky- P to kyy which is blue actually I have that     
48:56     
reverse the white was the phosphor weighted the blue was the regular kiy     
49:01     
and if I add some attractant so this is all kyy this is in this runs so you can see the the pelum are kind of moving     
49:08     
back like this and when I when you saw the white it was the phosphorated so phosphorated with a white that was     
49:15     
binding look that explains why it was binding like that to the rotors and then     
49:21     
when the lelum were kind of coming out you know kind of flying out from the body that was a tumble so that's so I     
49:29     
guess you can see like how this process works as you add attractant or take attractant away so if you're adding     
49:36     
attractant nothing is phosphorilated in here and you get this eternal     
49:42     
run okay why do you need all this complexity um you know you could imagine     
49:47     
where the motors cells respond directly to an attractant so this is not a linear     
49:52     
process uh and why do you need all this sort of complexity and the answer might be that     
49:59     
you know this is the way it evolved or the other answer might be that because you need to have this sort of dynamical     
50:06     
system where things are controlled kind of based on uh stochastic     
50:13     
gradients uh we'll see later though that the stream of Ky y-p acts as a kind of     
50:19     
adaptable tuning mechanical amplifier so there's this other aspect of this which     
50:24     
is that it's a cybernetic system uh where you have this sort of uh     
50:30     
tunable chemical aspect or tunable amplifier aspect so this is where     
50:35     
bacterial cells can amplify signals of more than 50 fold that is to say a 2% change in receptor occupancy can bring     
50:43     
about 100% change in the output of the system at the flugel motors so this     
50:48     
means that you know when you add in a certain number of uh when the receptor     
50:54     
occupancy is higher you can get uh different types of different magnitudes of change in     
51:00     
output this feature allows cells to sense minute changes and concentration     
51:06     
less than three molecules per cell volume so you can get uh changes or you can get responses of very low levels of     
51:14     
concentration of Cho uh chemoattracted so you know when we talk about things     
51:20     
like the you know integrating these signals and finding the position in     
51:27     
space that has the next highest concentration of chemical um what we're     
51:32     
basically doing is we're basically doing single cell psychophysics and in psychophysics you     
51:38     
know you have these sort of least just noticeable or you know uh smallest     
51:43     
detectable differences and so that's what it's doing it's basically setting up this sort of psychophysics in a     
51:49     
single cell it's taking very very small concentrations and finding the difference between when it finds the     
51:55     
difference it can actually change the behavior of the cell of the rotors and     
52:00     
it can change the strategy of how it explores its environment so it's very     
52:06     
important to get those very you know small levels of detection and be able to     
52:13     
uh enable them so in reality eoli is able to     
52:20     
respond sensitively across five orders of magnitude of attracting concentration     
52:25     
the cell learns to treat what whatever concentration it stumbles into is The New Normal so that the slightest     
52:30     
increase trigger the same hypers sensitive response     
52:36     
um and so methylation of The receptors gives eoli a simple chemical memory this     
52:43     
is a powerful and somewhat profound idea individual bacteria can model their environment remember the important     
52:49     
features of it by encoding that information in internal chemical modifications so I skipped over the part     
52:55     
where they talk about the methylation step um but this is where you get     
53:01     
methylation uh or methyl groups that bind to the structural proteins and this is uh where you can     
53:08     
turn the transcriptional Machinery on and off and it can     
53:13     
actually uh enable some of this uh signal processing basically um so ecoi     
53:22     
knows whether an attractant has become more or less concentrated and it's surrounding is going back several     
53:28     
seconds that helps it determine these kind of changes in swimming     
53:33     
Direction which is not that different in principle from what brains do and in fact one reason that it requires an     
53:39     
artificial neural network of about a thousand elements just to model the computational capabilities of a single     
53:45     
real neuron is that the real neurons store so much state in its internal chemistry so the point here is that     
53:52     
neurons store a lot of State in the chemical uh reactions in the different     
53:58     
types of uh things that go on and there's all sorts of stuff like this     
54:03     
phosphorilation other types of things uh so this internal chemistry stores a lot of information there's a lot of State in     
54:11     
sort of substate information and so it requires a very large artificial neural     
54:16     
network to model single neurons uh this is this thousand     
54:22     
elements this is a paper uh from neuron single cortical     
54:29     
neurons single cortical neurons as deep artificial neural networks this is     
54:34     
from those authors here and basically talk they wanted to model a single neuron as a deep neural network so     
54:43     
cortical neurons are well approximated by a deep neural network with 5 to eight layers deep neural Network's depth     
54:49     
arises from the interaction between MDM nmda receptors and dendritic morphology     
54:55     
dendritic branches can be conceptualized as a set of spatio temporal pattern detectors so this is where the dendritic     
55:02     
branches are serving kind of as this information integration much as our surface receptors and     
55:08     
eoli the depth of this deep neural network arises from a lot of chemical     
55:14     
interactions uh and dendritic morphology so a lot of combinatorial chemical     
55:20     
information so that's what they mean by uh a neural netork work of about a     
55:26     
thousand elements modeling the internal state of a cell where there are a lot of chemical interactions so this is     
55:33     
interesting there these parallels between neurons and what ecoi are doing so this is and and ecoi do this     
55:40     
signaling as well as within single so this kind of gives this is a     
55:47     
video of Eco chemotaxis and showing sort of the     
55:52     
molecular events um and giv back to Dennis     
55:57     
Bray uh where Dennis Bray talks about     
56:04     
this and so this is just kind of finishing up we get has some nice diagrams here and um kind of talking     
56:12     
more about cellular information processing this is a very long article not going to get into too much more of     
56:19     
it but I will provide these readings um later I will put them in the annotation     
56:26     
for the video and I will put them in the slack     
56:38     
chat so are there any     
56:54     
questions I love the um working single cell yeah you like like     
57:01     
you said um or just just the idea of single cell psychop     
57:07     
physics yeah and um yeah just how much how much Levan     
57:16     
uses that and motivating his you know agential     
57:22     
matter kind of program Etc too you know     
57:29     
yeah yeah I think it also it's interesting how like they bring this parallel one with neural networks and     
57:35     
like they say that you know you have basically you can use a neural network to model this but it's it's got to be     
57:40     
fairly big so we think of sometimes we think of neural networks as like analogies of the brain but it's actually     
57:48     
just an analogy of a lot of the combinatorial steps that go into something like a     
57:54     
complex chemical system so you have all these chemical interactions sort of mimic this     
58:00     
connectivity um and you saw that with the you know like the comparison made     
58:06     
between ecoi and kyy you know exchange with like a connectome with an inter so     
58:13     
if you have a brain birg vehicle with an inner neuron between the sensor and Factor you essentially have this keyy     
58:19     
system but of course in the sensor and a factor it's much more constrained than when you have a th000 molecules was     
58:26     
bouncing around cell and go you know make having these chemical transformation steps and there's this     
58:33     
different aspect to control them so yeah but     
58:39     
sure yeah that's really interesting yeah     
58:48     
thanks right well let's call it a meeting um all right that's good thanks     
58:57     
take care bye all right let's have a little bit of     
59:04     
a talk about what we've covered today so one of the things we saw in seans and in     
59:13     
ecoi is this commonality of like sort of     
59:20     
neural and I'll put in quotes control and then C alans it was     
59:29     
eggling and in ecoi it was the Fel rotor controler Fel     
59:36     
rotors and control of the different behaviors you also saw Behavioral or     
59:42     
evolutionary     
59:51     
tradeoffs and this had to do with how to say make changes in behavioral output in     
59:57     
ecoi make changes in reproductive strategy and see Elegance so     
1:00:08     
that's so now I want to talk a little bit about psychophysics and single cell psychophysics so this is a term I coined     
1:00:17     
here and this you know psychophysics is actually field of     
1:00:23     
study where they look at in would stimuli like a light     
1:00:28     
source or some sort of chemical     
1:00:34     
gradient and you have some sort of you know sensory input to an     
1:00:39     
organism it could be a brain work vehicle it could be a human it could be     
1:00:45     
a celegans and in short you have these     
1:00:51     
receptors that Tak in sensory information you have an output which is     
1:00:57     
motor output or a factor and you have something in between that transforms that sensory signal into an output or a     
1:01:04     
behavioral output and so like we said in celegans you can have a vehicle     
1:01:15     
or I used an U an analogy with a brenberg vehicle which is what this is     
1:01:21     
so we have a brbg vehicle with their sensors and     
1:01:27     
affectors and we have something in between we have this very simple     
1:01:34     
connectone where we have inputs from the sensors that go to an inter neuron and     
1:01:42     
then that maps to our vectors we can do that in a number of     
1:01:47     
ways we can have a direct mapping between sensor and affector let me draw     
1:01:54     
the springboard vehicle really large you can see you can have direct mappings between     
1:02:01     
sensor and fector alternatively you can have inter     
1:02:08     
neurons between sensor and Vector so you can have something like     
1:02:16     
this or alternative to that you can have many inputs or many     
1:02:22     
[Music] interneurons between the s or an     
1:02:28     
factor and it can look like that so you you're getting the start uh sort of the beginnings of a small     
1:02:34     
connectone and the small connectone can have you know n number of     
1:02:42     
cells and M number of     
1:02:49     
connections okay so that's where we're going now of course in in ecoi what we     
1:02:55     
saw was that we don't need that connectome at all what we need is we need we can     
1:03:01     
draw sort of a a eoli version of a vehicle and we have the effectors     
1:03:10     
here and the sensors up here which are the sensory inputs from     
1:03:17     
the sort of the anterior end of this of the cell and the posterior end is where     
1:03:23     
we have these affectors we mentioned that these rotors are driven by binding     
1:03:29     
activity of phosphorilated part of phosphorated     
1:03:35     
molecules so key key Y and key Y is activated up at the     
1:03:42     
sensors and it travels around the cytoplasm to binds at the uh rotors at     
1:03:50     
the affectors so it starts off keyy just starts off on F phosphorated up the     
1:03:57     
sensors that gains a phosphorilated state within the cell cytoplasm and then it binds in the     
1:04:04     
phosphor weighted State down at the affector so you actually don't need um a     
1:04:10     
connecton for that at all you just need a bag of sort of a bag of     
1:04:22     
stochasticity right and so that actually works just as well your interneurons are these     
1:04:28     
interactions or actually your interneurons are these phosphor relation events that occur and so you have in     
1:04:35     
this case n     
1:04:45     
molecules M phosphorilation events     
1:04:56     
and I guess o binding EVS remember we have to fraction     
1:05:03     
out all of these things they happen at a certain probability so     
1:05:09     
uh so you have n molecules M phosphorilation events and O     
1:05:16     
binding events so something you know when you have a sensory input you can just say that it's it maps to a certain     
1:05:24     
key y or a certain fraction of keyys then those phosphorilation events     
1:05:30     
are not a one to one mapping there's a fraction of them become phosphorilated and then some fraction of phosphorated     
1:05:36     
ones bind to the affector and drive that and so then you can model all     
1:05:44     
that now the psych psychophysics is interesting because we can build of course you know what we call a     
1:05:50     
connectionist model in in that one paper that we talked about it's deep it's a deep neural network but essentially it's     
1:05:56     
a connectionist model of um this process and so you can build     
1:06:02     
this connectionist model and so when you're building a connectionist model of what's going on in the BR vehicle which     
1:06:08     
is back here you see it's basically already a connectionist model we have the cells and connections and so we just     
1:06:14     
replicate that over here and we see that it's you know of a very low complexity     
1:06:20     
where we have sensors we have inter neurons we have affectors right so we     
1:06:26     
have you know this kind of mapping it's pretty simple it doesn't really involve a lot of     
1:06:35     
depth but as that paper we reviewed said uh where they were mapping chemical     
1:06:41     
constituents or chemical reactions to deep nural networks it requires many layers of the deep nural Network and in     
1:06:47     
fact thousands of units and so the question is is you know I guess in one hand you can see why that is because you     
1:06:54     
have this bag of stas you have a lot of these interactions and you need to characterize them each with a node and a     
1:07:00     
deep neural network each with a layer and you get this it's hard to get the pattern to come out um in the brenberg     
1:07:08     
vehicle would be interesting is if you had a very large deep nald simulating     
1:07:13     
this connection between stimulus and response or sensor and affector so you     
1:07:20     
know and maybe that would help you if you wanted to have brenberg vehicles with a very long memory because as we     
1:07:26     
said these kinds of systems the bag of stochasticity they have a memory without     
1:07:31     
any sort of neural substrate and that memory can be relatively long for a     
1:07:37     
chemical system so it can be on the order of seconds uh not milliseconds and so this     
1:07:43     
is something that you know is kind of an interesting     
1:07:49     
aspect so if we think of like you know very like sort of biologically inspired     
1:07:55     
systems you know how do we enable memory without any sort of neural substrate how do we     
1:08:02     
enable memory with very simple neural substrate and I think some of the answers are coming from this sort of     
1:08:07     
comparison between bring the     
1:08:14     
vehicles and eoli     
1:08:20     
mod so that's what we have here um     
1:08:26     
now the psychophysics aspect is interesting because we actually published a paper on this I think last     
1:08:34     
year so this was in 2023 we have the psychophysical world of the motile Daton basaria     
1:08:41     
paradoxa basilar Paradox of course is this uh single cell organism that lives     
1:08:46     
in a colony of multicellular colony and they move collectively so you can model     
1:08:52     
the collective behavior of the cell of the cells the cells have their own sort of world     
1:08:58     
where they you know each have their own behavior they synchronize their behavior they have things out in the environment     
1:09:05     
that they use as cues and so we developed in this paper some interesting     
1:09:11     
psychophysical metrics or interesting psychophysical sort of uh contexts for     
1:09:17     
this type of of uh diom and so datom are a group of algae     
1:09:26     
so these are not uh ecoi but they're actually a bit more complicated but     
1:09:32     
again they don't have a neural substrate and they're able to uh you know attain     
1:09:37     
this sort of collective Behavior this complex Collective behavior um we are we     
1:09:44     
cite in explicitly in the paper the Weber feckner law which is a law of     
1:09:49     
perception where you're able to look at a a bunch of dots and sort of estimate     
1:09:55     
how many dots there are and the idea is to be able to differentiate between like     
1:10:01     
100 dots and 102 dots and we talked about this with respect to our model     
1:10:07     
systems that one of the goals of this sort of you know I guess magas do castic     
1:10:12     
City psychophysics so I'm going to write that down     
1:10:33     
is to sort of come up with this model for sort of all these things happening     
1:10:39     
in a in a space these processing units having a clearly     
1:10:47     
defined effector something that this is affecting and     
1:10:52     
sensors something that's sensing so if I give     
1:10:57     
this agent a bunch of dots and I ask to     
1:11:02     
estimate how many dots there are it has to do a couple things it has     
1:11:08     
to make an estimate of number and there's been a     
1:11:14     
lot of work on like the Weber feckner law and what you're actually doing when     
1:11:19     
a human does the trust and basically you know it could be that you're counting the number of dots but in fact your     
1:11:26     
short turn memory can't deal with that large number of dots you can't actually sit there and count in a very short     
1:11:32     
amount of time how many dots there so what you're actually doing is you're estimating the shape of the dots and you're so you're     
1:11:40     
actually estimating shape and fullness of that shape and it's it's kind of a standin     
1:11:47     
for numerosity you're estimating a number from that so if I showed you like     
1:11:52     
a circle you know with this number of dots you're basically estimating the density of     
1:11:59     
dots and then you're estimating the size of the     
1:12:05     
circle and so you're doing a you're using a lot of these her istics that are not direct counting but they're direct     
1:12:13     
kind of estimating and so the the thing about that is like when you have a 100 dots     
1:12:19     
you can do that and when you have 102 dots you can do the same thing and it's hard to know kind of where the threshold     
1:12:25     
is where does the density become a little thicker where does the shape become a little larger that's the kind     
1:12:32     
of thing you're using as that estimator so you're basically using sort of a differential it's different uh     
1:12:37     
differentiated learning because you're using this differential between the two estimates to get your     
1:12:45     
answer so in the bag of stochasticity psychophysics you have this input these     
1:12:52     
uh dots these interactions within the bag of stochasticity these reactions are     
1:12:58     
going to be in this case we'll say they're chemical reactions there's uh C     
1:13:03     
probabilistic binding to the effector so this this is probabilistic     
1:13:12     
activity and from that we need to have some sort of     
1:13:18     
like was an estimator natural estimator or some sort sort of     
1:13:26     
um     
1:13:34     
naturalistic so one of the things about eoli system is that we know that it can     
1:13:39     
do this kind of um you know regulation it can do this     
1:13:44     
sort of uh cybernetic regulation this dynamical regulation but and we know it     
1:13:52     
has a memory because it has its memory of the order of seconds which may be just an effect of like you     
1:13:57     
know kind of information coming in and those molecules being sort of not     
1:14:04     
extinguished you know there's a Decay rate for molecules and if they accumulate there's a memory there so     
1:14:10     
there's molecular accumulation and that's     
1:14:22     
memory but then of course we need to have a way to build these her istics     
1:14:27     
these estimator her istics estimation her     
1:14:39     
istics so what is that what is that mechanism in the system for now I don't really know what the answer is uh it     
1:14:46     
could be that you know you have like maybe if you were to do an artificial version of this you might have a certain     
1:14:51     
number of molecules in in the bag and depending on the number of molecules that might help you with the     
1:14:58     
estimation uh so you know there might be like you might extinguish a proportion of these molecules to get to the number     
1:15:06     
or you might use some sort of like um differential filter you know to find     
1:15:14     
derivatives of the of the number of the input you could also remember like exact     
1:15:20     
numbers of things are trained on but you can't train it now I mean I guess you train it but it's it's a it's a fleeting     
1:15:27     
memory it doesn't last very long so you would have to have something to uh     
1:15:32     
enable that estimation maybe you could compartmentalize this bag of stochasticity into     
1:15:39     
Parts you know like we like any good modeler would do they compartmentalize     
1:15:44     
their model where they have like some process going on here and then it transfers down here and then it     
1:15:51     
transfers down to the affector but we want to remain true to the the sort of the ecoi model so maybe we don't do that     
1:15:58     
but in any case you can see how uh as you increase biological complexity you might get these kind of systems that can     
1:16:04     
do these kind of estimator estimation ads so this is like basically an     
1:16:10     
integrator um you know this is integration basically finding the     
1:16:16     
derivatives so those are kind of my thoughts     
1:16:21     
on this sort of interesting set of relation ships uh if you have any questions let     
1:16:28     
me know thank you for paying attention
