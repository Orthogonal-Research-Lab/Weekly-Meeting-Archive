hello hello how are you I'm pretty good great did I turn it     
0:10     
back on I did okay haven't seen you in a couple     
0:17     
weeks yeah I was on vacation oh okay that's good went to Barbados oh wow good     
0:24     
got a sunburn and a um a bruised me oh     
0:29     
yeah yeah it breaks up the winter if you can     
0:36     
go somewhere in the middle oh yeah yeah last year we went to the physics     
0:43     
conference in March okay in Las Vegas oh right that     
0:49     
helped and this year I'm just going to attend it virtually because it's 170     
0:56     
bucks Canadian so like what's that us like not very     
1:02     
much it's good yeah yeah I missed a couple of things well what happened well     
1:09     
we we had actually some good discussions last week on um you know some papers on     
1:15     
biophysics there were some uh physical networks and other uh actually we had a     
1:22     
paper on you know that paper set of papers you talked about uh Tri     
1:27     
Junctions oh yeah yeah they had a paper where there were like multiple I guess you could call them like uh quad     
1:34     
Junctions and Penta Junctions and things like that oh would you could you send me     
1:40     
that or yeah I will yeah I'm sure there's more than try     
1:46     
Junctions because things move around a lot yeah I just didn't know like if you     
1:52     
had run ACR like how deep you were into that literature um not that much but knowing     
1:59     
that that it that there are Junctions there instead of um the meeting of cell membranes that     
2:07     
that adds to the the morphology of the surface yeah     
2:14     
so um so when you're you're doing a a a     
2:21     
a graphic design of of the surface um     
2:26     
and looking at at its physical characteristics and changes it I don't know by how much because they're they're     
2:33     
very tiny the Junctions are are tiny yeah Bradley have you heard from V all     
2:40     
uh not this week no I mean he was here last week at the meeting oh okay because uh he hasn't     
2:48     
been answering emails oh I don't know yeah oh okay unusual for him yeah well I     
2:54     
just wondered what was up with him too because I sent him a couple of papers about     
3:00     
mitochondria I'm interested in the the high voltage between the uh membranes in     
3:08     
mitochondria and anywhere else just wondering if you could maybe if that     
3:14     
would disrupt disrupt or distort infrared     
3:20     
light as then could you detect whether a cell is alive using your Optical cerence     
3:27     
tomography like I wonder if you could do that maybe it's just too fine a thing     
3:33     
to even to worry about but you know that's     
3:38     
Michel 11 it yeah the bioelectric stuff     
3:43     
yeah but anyway that's what I was after did he know anything about that like if     
3:49     
it's a it is a fairly High um electrical gradient     
3:57     
so question is is it detectable as a distortion of of     
4:05     
light yeah because it would be nice to know if your cell was alive if you could     
4:11     
kind of that in tomography while you were working with the cell     
4:19     
so I recall doing a time lapse one weekend uh where uh at the end of the     
4:26     
time lapse we actually slept in the lab at the end of the time lapse it was     
4:32     
clear the Emory was dead yeah yes yes it's that sort of thing yeah if you     
4:38     
could if you could just kind of tell whether you thought it was alive that     
4:44     
that would be helpful     
4:52     
yeah want to introduce     
4:57     
yourself SL I didn't want to inter the conversation     
5:02     
okay I am Pak Balia I'm from India I am currently a third year     
5:11     
undergraduate student which what which uh     
5:17     
Department uh I'm in artificial intelligence uh oh     
5:23     
okay I'm from am vishya Pam College in     
5:29     
Kerala and yeah I would uh like to contribute     
5:36     
to your open source projects like last year I wanted to try     
5:42     
but then I thought I wasn't prepared enough this time I have prepared myself     
5:47     
and I think I'll will be able to make some meaningful contributions to your     
5:53     
projects well that's nice yeah that's I haven't gotten into AI myself at all     
6:00     
yeah I was going to and then I got hit with a bunch of other things so yeah     
6:06     
well welcome to the group uh yeah so we haven't announced the gck projects yet the Google summer of code projects but     
6:13     
we'll be doing that soon uh usually you know it's it's going to be very similar     
6:18     
to La last year's project but um you know but I I'm I'm assuming you know     
6:25     
about like uh Evo learn and some of the things that we did last year yeah and so     
6:32     
yeah we'll we'll be talking about that more in coming weeks so yeah welcome to the group     
6:39     
and yeah so yeah in the group we usually talk about a lot of things we sometimes talk about more biological stuff     
6:46     
sometimes more AI stuff so hope you you'll find this useful yeah yeah I I'm actually     
6:53     
interested in in merging like AI with medical Sciences because I feel like it has a lot to help in the medical field I     
7:01     
am uh currently doing like a research project with one of my mentors it's about uh uh segmenting the facial     
7:09     
features to determine the level of paralysis a person might have so that     
7:14     
project is in process right now so currently we are able to detect like the     
7:21     
how much degree of uh parales the person has there there are more aspects to the     
7:26     
project like we will try to make a system where we can monitor how well they are able to exercise to improve     
7:33     
their um like for faster healing process     
7:41     
yeah that's good all right so yeah uh let's see last     
7:49     
week we did a number of uh biophysics papers I think four in total we went     
7:55     
through a bunch of different topics we did something on network works and like     
8:01     
uh I don't know we talked about a paper uh previously where they had these rods     
8:07     
in a packing and they were moving around and they were moving around their radius     
8:12     
of uh gyration and kind of do you know moving together and this one was about     
8:19     
building networks like that where you have a node and there's a radius around     
8:24     
which the node travels and then you have a bunch of rods that do that     
8:29     
and then there's some connectivity there they called it spaghetti packings or something like that which I thought that     
8:36     
was interesting um we did another paper on uh cell sheets and uh looking at the     
8:44     
different Junctions that the cells make during morphogenesis so Susan at one     
8:50     
time uh last year I think late last year was reading some papers on Tri Junctions     
8:57     
where the cells come together in in this three-fold Junction and in this paper     
9:02     
they talked about four Junctions and five Junctions and you know higher order Junctions where the cells are migrating     
9:10     
within the sheet and they're forming these Junctions and it has a lot to say about differentiation and some of the     
9:17     
things going on there so uh those are some interesting     
9:23     
papers uh and I'll send Susan a copy of the one on the Junctions um     
9:30     
later so yeah and then today I kind of wanted to talk a little bit about something dick sent me an email about     
9:36     
over the holiday and I didn't get a CH actually I did get a chance to look over things but we didn't get a chance to do     
9:43     
anything else with it and uh let me share my     
9:48     
screen so this is about um lineage independent     
9:56     
differentiation so dick sent me this he he he was really excited about this     
10:01     
literature on lineage independ independent differentiation and this is something that you find large o plants     
10:08     
although we'll see some of the papers that uh I have in this folder and what     
10:13     
they what they have to say about it so I mean and this is just like a     
10:19     
very quick overview of some things I found uh doing literature search so this     
10:24     
is just kind of the starting of a topical deep dive into this so if I you     
10:31     
know if there's something that I missed it's probably because I didn't really do a very good job of looking     
10:37     
but uh so this is actually in botney so I'm not really that familiar with botney     
10:43     
relative to animals so uh but this is the Journal of experimental botany uh     
10:49     
and this is uh paper cell identity specification in Plants lessons from flower development so this is U again in     
10:59     
plants and you know the way that development proceeds there so this kind     
11:06     
of talks about uh this this idea of lineage independent     
11:12     
differentiation uh multicellular organisms display a fascinating complexity of cellular identities and     
11:18     
patterns of diversification the concept of cell type aims to describe and categorize as     
11:25     
complexity in this review we discussed the traditional concept of cell types     
11:30     
and highlight the impact of cell single cell Technologies and spatial omics on     
11:36     
the understanding of cellular differentiation in plants so that's like a typical thing that we might do we     
11:43     
summarize and compare position based and lineage based mechanisms so they     
11:48     
differentiate between position based and lineage based mechanisms so I take a     
11:54     
position based are things that are sort of have positional information or something     
11:59     
like that uh and then lineage based is where they have this you know like something like celegans where if the     
12:07     
cell divides it's in this lineage that ends up restricted to a number of Fates     
12:13     
those are the two mechanisms of cell identity specification and they use flower development as a model system and more     
12:21     
than understanding onto genetic origins of different gated cells so they want to know like kind of the origins of     
12:28     
different different cells that become other cells an important question to plant science is to understand their     
12:35     
position and development stage specific heterogeneity and so they get into this     
12:41     
about uh the action of cross talk and external and internal signals this converges on transcription     
12:49     
factors at orchestr gene expression pro programs so this kind of talks about but     
12:54     
this actually this first part talks about how to define a cell type of plant     
12:59     
so defining cell types is sometimes a tricky business um I know that uh you know some     
13:08     
of our there are groups that are always trying to Define like cell types and     
13:13     
especially if you're doing like machine learning of cell types or machine     
13:18     
learning of cells uh you might want to know like have a methodology for defining cell     
13:24     
types so we've talked about this before where you have cell types that can be defined by their markers their     
13:31     
phenotypic characteristics their shape sometimes you have a marker that's     
13:36     
expressed by a certain type of cell but that doesn't mean that that cell is you     
13:42     
know that all those kind of cells are the same there's a lot of heterogeneity there all that means is it's expressing     
13:47     
that specific marker so you might go in and look at the gene expression profile     
13:52     
maybe like a sequencing technology and find a lot of variation in that cell     
13:59     
you know you might find some cryptic version of a cell type uh but you know you wouldn't know that from the marker     
14:06     
maybe not even from the morphology so there are a lot of different ways you can define a cell um so a cell type is classically     
14:14     
defined by phenotype and function we've added molecular signatures to that uh     
14:20     
less than 20 major cell types are classically assigned in vascular plants     
14:25     
so this is from 1989 so this means that there's a very small number of cell types in vascular plants and I I'm not     
14:33     
again not familiar with plants but I mean you know I don't know how many functions there are in plants that are     
14:41     
as opposed to animals that would be kind of an interesting question to ask but uh     
14:46     
at least in this case as of 1989 we had less than 20 major cell types so this     
14:51     
was this number this count was probably based on looking at the phenotype and     
14:56     
function instead of more of the molecular signatures because yeah for     
15:02     
Animals I've seen figures from around 250 to 7,000     
15:09     
yeah well they say major cell types too so I'm not sure how that compares with     
15:15     
but you know still it's it's probably it's probably not magnitude or two less yeah     
15:22     
yeah okay those classical cell type Concepts aim to generalize cellular identity it     
15:30     
may not entirely cover the complexity and cellular diversity of cells so this is what I was saying with you might have     
15:37     
cryptic cell types or transitional cell types and they just have one of those CR one of those markers meet one of the     
15:44     
criterian and so that's that's where you get a lot of you know that's where you get a lot of variation in the     
15:51     
number um see if I can get down to something that's informative here     
15:59     
uh so in in very practical terms this creates challenges this is talking about some of the uh aspects of like Gene     
16:08     
duplication followed by sub neofunctionalization co-option of genes     
16:13     
and Gene regulatory modules uh so this is these are all the things that you find in diff you know across species and     
16:20     
plants and in animals for that matter so those are things that can add to this     
16:25     
diversification of cell types uh in many in very practical terms this creates challenges for instance since many     
16:32     
developmental control genes act in more than one developmental process uh that can be a problem so many     
16:39     
genes controlling vegetative Leaf development are also expressed in Floral organs so you get these genes that are     
16:47     
uh involved in vegetative Leaf development and they might be duplicated and then co-opted for another     
16:54     
process uh and then that's that's where you have you know so those those copies     
16:59     
of those genes do something different their activities are modulated to give rise to specific structures of floral     
17:06     
organs this often makes it hard to identify marker genes that are very specifically expressed in only one cell     
17:13     
type or different stages so again you know this is the idea of using a marker     
17:19     
to say this is uh this marker positive these cells and so you're going to have     
17:26     
some variation there one might compare the problem of defining a cell type with that of the     
17:33     
species concept and it so it can be difficult to distinguish cell types from States and cells at the same identity     
17:40     
may appear very different from each other in terms of gene expression profiles so there oh go yeah do they     
17:50     
discuss the sensial plant uh I don't see anything here     
17:59     
because you know a sensial elgo can have different parts that look like and look     
18:05     
like STS Etc yeah so that the     
18:10     
differentiation is actually subsol     
18:18     
right make a     
18:26     
not the this spectacular form are the uh uh oh shoot what do you call them     
18:33     
uh the Kelps you can have Kelps that are cellular yeah and you can which can be     
18:40     
100 meters long or you can have Kelps that could be 100 meters long and one cell     
18:56     
yeah you mean like just a s gets bigger no oh one cell one cell the whole plant     
19:03     
is one cell oh yeah yeah okay yeah and yet it has different     
19:12     
parts right okay has many nuclei     
19:18     
right okay but the nuclei seem to stream around so I don't know what they're     
19:24     
doing yeah well yeah I don't know if they talk     
19:30     
about sential cells or yeah that sort of thing in here but uh so they give some     
19:37     
examples from from Plants uh sort of talking about how cell types that together     
19:45     
constitute the epidermis tissue um and they talk about some of     
19:51     
the aspects of these these cells uh you know and then together the     
19:57     
example of the epidermal shows that the cell type composition of tissues can be variable across organs in a plant and     
20:04     
the individual cell types can have different phenotypes and function um and then of course they can     
20:10     
also cell types cell type frequencies within tissues can be plastic and     
20:15     
affected by environmental factors as well so this is and then they talk about     
20:20     
cellular differentiation being different reversible implants under specific     
20:26     
conditions um this shows kind of the diversity of plant or cell types in plants so you get different types of     
20:34     
cells um and then this is sort of the uh this is the uh I guess the gene     
20:40     
expression Network for tri Chrome and non Tri Chrome cells so this is let's see     
20:49     
um yeah this is b b is movement of R3 myb functions as a positional signal for     
20:56     
triome patterning so this R3 myb is plays a different role in this     
21:01     
expression Network than it is here um so yeah this is kind of what they're getting at in     
21:09     
this review uh so this talks about cell lineage versus positional signal so uh     
21:18     
fundamental concept of epigenetic landscape visualize a cell differentiation is a ball rolling down a     
21:23     
valley in a landscape that is sculpted by regulatory genes and their combinatorial     
21:29     
activities um and so in the animal field reconstruction of cell lineage history     
21:36     
is often used to understand cellular differentiation programs so that's these reviews here a classical example is for     
21:45     
utilizing the lineage Concept in plants is stamata development which is initiated from a lineage specific stem     
21:52     
cell by a series of defined asymmetric cell divisions controlled by consec     
21:58     
tively acting regulatory factors and enforced by cell cell signaling uh but many experiments have     
22:06     
shown that the developmental fate of a plant cell does not depend strictly on its lineage but on its exact position     
22:13     
within the growing plant body uh in early studies plant scientists utilize Mosaic or cha     
22:21     
experiments to uh trace the lineage of a cell type by labeling cell clones with     
22:26     
genetically phenotypic traits such as pyy level or albinism so these are uh     
22:33     
distinct things for a plant and tracking the mitotic descendants of marked cells     
22:39     
and so these Studies have shown that plant cells do not follow strict lineages and their Fates are not     
22:45     
predetermined but rely on positional information or cell cell     
22:52     
interactions that's that's true of animal cells too yeah yeah except they     
22:58     
if you go back to wton uh animal cells uh have what's     
23:04     
called commitment right but the commitment can depend on where they are     
23:15     
right so I don't think that's a good distinction right I was wondering about     
23:21     
that because I'm like well I think that's also true of of animals but uh the the other thing uh I don't     
23:28     
know if they discussed it here but uh the other thing that uh to keep in mind     
23:33     
is that a plant like fucus has     
23:38     
embryos okay yeah the embryos the embryos can develop and     
23:44     
so I don't know if there's any study of the development most people in that I     
23:50     
knew in fucus uh were just mostly interested in the egg itself     
23:56     
right so I don't know if any lineage work has been done on     
24:05     
fucus yeah so this is this is kind of what     
24:11     
they're get like at least in this paper this is what they're getting at for lineage uh independent development so I     
24:17     
mean we find uh you know positional information dependence or whatever you want to call     
24:23     
it in animal cells as well and in fact we know that the in say like mammals     
24:29     
it's it's kind of hard to construct an exact lineage tree uh from from uh     
24:35     
developing cells than an embryo just that they're not always the same cell that they kind of proliferate a cell     
24:41     
type and then those cells are uh you know get signals from their neighbors and they kind of determine the cell type     
24:48     
so this is some not something that's unique to plants but of course in fitting it into the epigenetic landscape     
24:56     
you know that's that's I mean that's not necess not necessarily here nor there it's just kind of um a different way of     
25:03     
doing it um and so they talk about you know this sort of positional     
25:09     
information uh appro or this perspective where you know plant cells May alter     
25:14     
their identity when positional signals are changed this is exemplified by observations on wound healing and d and     
25:22     
redifferentiation so sometimes you'll get D differentiation in certain context where     
25:28     
there's regeneration or wound healing so cells of a certain type like a muscle cell in animals will e differentiate     
25:36     
into like a stem cell state or a precursor State and then redifferentiate as it divides a little bit and     
25:43     
redifferentiate so it replenishes that cell type in that region and you can get     
25:49     
that sort of process as well now this yeah this kind so this     
25:54     
kind of talks about this uh inter terms of plants though and you know they kind     
26:00     
of go through some of the aspects of     
26:05     
uh of uh positional dependence so yeah     
26:11     
and then the rest of this a lot of this paper is going to be molecular stuff that I'm not going to get into so let's     
26:17     
go to the other papers this this paper here is um     
26:25     
see this paper here is a little bit this is actually in animals so this is in silicle analysis     
26:32     
to explore lineage independent and dependent transcriptional programs     
26:37     
associated with endothelial and neural differentiation of human induced plur     
26:42     
potent stem cells so again we have this term lineage Independence in animal cells and so this is uh where they do     
26:52     
some experiments here with uh actually with IPS cells so so they want to     
26:58     
understand the EP endothelial cell type or the cell phenotype they want to they     
27:04     
want to sort of get a better handle on the underlying molecular basis of this     
27:09     
process so they've in other work they previously reported that the generation     
27:16     
of ips cells from human umbilical vein into theal     
27:21     
cells uh can be done there's also the differentiation of resulting uh hips     
27:27     
cells back to endothelial cells so you can take a cell from end uh from human     
27:34     
umbilical uh vein they're endothelial cells you can turn them into these stem     
27:39     
cells that are induced and then you can differentiate them back to that cell     
27:45     
type so you know this is again where you give them in so we reprogramming you'll     
27:52     
often introduce uh you know genes that are overexpressed genes that will allow     
27:58     
a cell to become a stem cell from a differentiated cell and then when you redifferentiate the cells you're guiding     
28:05     
it's it's a little bit less uh direct you're guiding them down a certain     
28:10     
pathway with maybe putting other cells of the same type in the in the culture     
28:16     
or using a conditioned medium so this is uh kind of how they approach this in     
28:21     
animal studies and so those cells then are lineage independent     
28:28     
but you know maybe not because they actually uh the the resulting stem cells     
28:33     
are Flur potent but it's you know we we haven't really looked at the sort of the     
28:39     
range of cells that you can get usually in an experimental setting you might take like a a skin cell and     
28:46     
differentiate it maybe into a muscle cell or back into a skin cell uh it we     
28:52     
don't really know what the full range of Fates are for that uh for that plur potent cell     
28:58     
and so we know that plur potent cells can uh you know differentiate back into a range of Fates but we don't know what     
29:05     
the if given the source cell what the full range of things are that can be it     
29:10     
can differentiate into so this is you know I guess semi lineage semi-independent maybe is a good     
29:17     
way to put that um and so here we explored the same arrays to gain insight     
29:22     
into the gene alteration process that accompanies the establishment of endo theal versus non-endothelial neural cell     
29:30     
phenotypes we compared the expression of genes a code for transcription factors and epigenetic Regulators uh for this     
29:38     
hips Target uh phenotype our ENC silico analysis which means they did some     
29:45     
bioinformatics have identified cohorts of genes that are similarly up or down regulated in both lineages as well as     
29:52     
those that exhibit lineage specific alterations based on these results we     
29:57     
propose that genes that are similarly altered in both lineages participate in priming the stem cell for     
30:04     
differentiation in a lineage independent manner so in this case what they're looking at they're looking at gene     
30:10     
expression and they're identifying different genes that are upregulated and down regulated these exhibit lineage     
30:18     
specific alterations and what they're just basically saying is that uh there is no     
30:24     
lineage dependence that they can see uh in in their in their uh study whereas     
30:30     
those that are differentially altered in endothelial compared to neuros cells     
30:36     
participate in a lineage specific differentiation process so this is where     
30:41     
you have cells that are differentially altered uh in endothelial cells those     
30:48     
are different those participate in a lineage specific differentiation process     
30:53     
so uh depending on the cell type or the original or or I guess it's some sort of they're     
31:01     
doing these alterations and depending on what you know what kind of alterations are made     
31:08     
yeah so they're actually uh they're doing this working from this neural n and diff cell lineage     
31:16     
that contain both neurons and astrocytes so the one that contain neurons and Astros     
31:21     
sites actually uh had a different pattern than the ones that just the sore     
31:27     
cells that just contained the hips cells or the endothelial cells so that's     
31:33     
interesting that they were able to make that distinction between lineage dependence and     
31:39     
Independence and you know it's just maybe a matter of what it can differentiate into so you know maybe in     
31:45     
neurons where uh in neural precursors you need to maybe achieve a larger range     
31:51     
of cell types and in endothelial cells maybe that's not so important so I I     
31:56     
don't know what why that exactly that would be the case but in addition we identifi distinct cohorts of     
32:03     
transcription factors and epigenetic Regulators his alterations correlated     
32:08     
specifically with the establishment of endothelial versus non-endothelial neural lineages so that's uh in animals     
32:16     
and so that's the way they approach lineage Independence     
32:21     
there the this paper here is uh talking about stem cell cells so this is     
32:30     
division Independence differentiation so this this is where you know we're     
32:35     
independent of division and we're talking about differentiation mandates proliferative     
32:41     
competition among stem cells so this is where you get different stem cells that proliferate at different rates and so     
32:48     
this is uh I think again maybe in it's inoph so this is again in     
32:55     
animals uh so this uh this talks about a little bit about these different cell     
33:01     
types cancer initiating gatekeeper mutations that arise in stem cells would     
33:07     
be especially potent if they stabilize and expand an affected stem cell lineage     
33:13     
it is therefore important to understand how different stem cells uh organization strategies promote or prevent variant     
33:20     
stem amplification or stem cell amplification in response to different types of mutation including those that     
33:28     
activate proliferation so they're looking at are these uh uh gatekeeper     
33:34     
mutations that do things uh sometimes they initiate cancer sometimes they may     
33:39     
initiate proliferation which is a part of how cancer spreads um and and so     
33:47     
forth yeah stupid question plants are know to have tumors yeah do those tumors     
33:56     
spread uh which what what is the tumor again or     
34:02     
do they spread okay oh I I don't know I've never heard of metastasis in     
34:09     
Plants oh in Plants uh yeah I don't know yeah I'm not sure if we get cancer     
34:18     
what kills you is it usually it spreads throughout your body right right but I've never heard of that     
34:25     
happen yeah I don't yeah I'm not familiar with     
34:32     
that okay throw it out as a uh okay so then stem cell numbers can     
34:40     
be maintained constant while producing differentiated products through individual asymmetric division outcomes     
34:47     
so this is where we have uh we're maintaining a constant number of stem cells uh the differentiated products     
34:55     
through individual asym metric division outcomes are by population asymmetry strategies     
35:01     
basically uh if you kind of uh proliferate a certain stem cell sort of     
35:09     
line you could call it a lineage from like a single cell and that cells the Mother cell when it can spread uh     
35:16     
asymmetrically so it's you know this is where you might have differentiated products within the cell that can spread     
35:24     
through like this differential uh reproduction     
35:29     
uh when which individual stem cell mines necessarily compete for Niche space so     
35:34     
you know if you think about like a a contained space and you had a bunch of stem cells that started off as mother     
35:41     
cells and they started to build this line these these lineages proliferate across the closed space like a culture     
35:49     
dish some lineages would out compete others just because they're able to uh     
35:54     
divide faster or or do other things and so that's what they're getting at here     
36:01     
we considered alternative mechanisms underlying population asymmetry and use quantitative modeling to predict starkly     
36:08     
different consequences of altering proliferation rate uh a variant faster proliferating mutant stem cell should     
36:15     
compete better only when stem cell division and differentiation are independent processes so this is where     
36:22     
your processes you know it doesn't hold doesn't follow that uh division implies     
36:29     
differentiation there's a different process there so you might get uh fast     
36:34     
Division and then you might get differentiation independent of that but you don't have like division doesn't     
36:41     
necess necessitate differentiation uh for most types of stem cell it has not been possible to     
36:48     
ascertain experimentally whether Division and differentiation are coupled so this is where they can't know this     
36:55     
for sure however dropa follicle stem cells which are in dropa uh it's a special type of stem     
37:02     
cell population provided a favorable system with which to investigate     
37:07     
population asymmetry mechanisms and also for measuring the impact of altered proliferation on competition so this is     
37:15     
where you know we want to see if we can find these asymmetry mechanisms and then     
37:20     
measure the impact of alter proliferation we found that from detailed cell lineage studies that     
37:27     
Division and differentiation of an individual individual pocal stem cell were not coupled so that they are able     
37:35     
in this model system to have a better handle on the difference between Division and differentiation and they     
37:42     
found that those are not coupled in this system we also found that FSC or     
37:47     
follicle stem cell representation reflecting maintenance and amplification     
37:52     
was highly responsive to genetic changes that altered only the rate of of follicle stem cell     
37:59     
proliferation this Paradigm uh provides definitive experimental evidence for the     
38:04     
general principle that relative proliferation rate will always be a major determinant of competition among     
38:11     
stem cells specifically when stem cell division and differentiation are independent so this is uh basically     
38:19     
showing that relative proliferation rate or one lineage proliferating faster than     
38:25     
or slower than the other will determine the competition amongst themel     
38:30     
lineages and this I guess this basically uh says that there's this it's     
38:38     
division independent that Division and differentiation are independent but it's not I guess I don't know if it's would     
38:45     
be considered lineage independent I guess it would be differentiation in this case might be lineage     
38:50     
independent um but that that's this is in a very specific model system Mrs     
38:57     
androp and uh so yeah and I'm not going to get into the whole paper uh but if     
39:04     
you're interested that would be something to look     
39:12     
into do that paper discuss fo foe foe Oh     
39:18     
you mean yeah her name uh know Virginia fo     
39:24     
right I don't recall the first name okay uh let's see I'll go down to the     
39:33     
references uh she she found that certain stages of     
39:38     
the S the uh differentiation seems to occur     
39:43     
in waves which see which may correspond to differentiation waves yeah     
39:51     
yeah yeah I don't see that I don't see that citation alphabetical     
39:57     
yeah search okay uh let's see I don't know if I can search the way I have it here     
40:04     
but oh I guess I can nope I don't see     
40:12     
it no but yeah that's     
40:20     
that's I'll just make another note okay so who who was that f e f yeah     
40:28     
Virginia fo oh her work was around     
40:39     
1993 yeah we talked about her before in the     
40:47     
gr okay so this uh all right that's that paper     
40:53     
uh okay uh so yeah this is one that took some notes on here um this is going back     
41:00     
to plants so we had two examples from animals one the original one was from Plants this one is going back to plants     
41:07     
so these are some notes Here in highlighted uh text here as you can see     
41:13     
uh the title was directed cellto cell movement of functional proteins and then     
41:19     
the question is do transcriptional factors double as signal molecules and plants so this is where they're asking     
41:27     
about cell cell communication and some of these uh     
41:33     
signals and what they look like so a couple of uh head a couple of     
41:39     
highlighted pieces here in plant sulfate is generally determined by position not     
41:45     
cell lineage so this is again we talked about this this is also true in animals     
41:50     
but that's kind of maybe what they mean is it's predominantly determined by by     
41:56     
position as opposed to in animals where you have cell lineages but again you know it depends on the organism you're     
42:02     
talking about uh and both cellular differentiation and organ development     
42:07     
depend on intracellular signaling so this is what we're talking about with signaling molecules and cell cell     
42:15     
communication and so uh but then you know what what is the question is what is that look like what are these signals     
42:22     
um a widely accepted Paradigm from the control of gene expression during development by intracellular signaling     
42:29     
specifies the release of small signal molecules by the signaling cell     
42:35     
perception by the Target cell transduction of the signal to the nucleus followed by modulation of     
42:41     
transcriptional control so you have h a a cell that's um sending a signal and     
42:50     
they're using small molecules and then the target cell has to perceive that and Rec recognize that     
42:57     
signal and then that signal has to be transduced to the nucleus from maybe     
43:02     
like a a surface receptor and then there has to be some action some some modulation of     
43:09     
transcriptional control so that's what the model is and of course it doesn't have to follow that model     
43:15     
exactly uh you know we know also from like uh you know uh synaptic     
43:20     
Communication in in neurons that you can also have processes that go out and you     
43:26     
can have in neurons you have formal synapses where chemical signals are     
43:33     
exchanged and that those can be quite complex the number of receptors and the     
43:39     
number of things released and those can Al you know those don't necessarily uh affect the uh nucleus     
43:48     
directly but a lot of times they do but so there's a lot of complexity in this in this communication     
43:54     
channel so that's what they're getting out with cell cell communication and so there's this     
44:01     
directed movement of functional proteins and so now however a new paradigm gaining attention proposes that     
44:08     
transcription factors themselves can act as signaling molecules and higher plants     
44:13     
moving between cells to activate gene expression at a distance from the site where they're originally produced so     
44:20     
that means you can have a transcription Factor that's expressed in the nucleus of one cell can be transported out into     
44:27     
the uh cytoplasm it can go to the uh uh membrane it can then be released and     
44:35     
dock with a neighboring cell go back into that cell cytoplasm end up in the     
44:41     
uh the nucleus there and initiate transcription in the same way did in the     
44:47     
first cell so that's what they're saying here uh this is a radical     
44:52     
hypothesis uh and they looked at plant viruses mediating uh intercellular movement of     
44:59     
viral proteins and nucleic acids by physical dilation of intracellular plant     
45:04     
organel is known as plasmo plasmo M     
45:09     
so this is something in plants that they've observed but then generalizing     
45:14     
it is a little bit radical of a hypothesis so uh although Lucas's     
45:21     
hypothesis for this type of trafficking of endogenous plant proteins was initially met with some skepticism a     
45:28     
major step towards this validation has now been taken by sessions used genetic     
45:34     
chimeras to demonstrate that cell to- cell movement of a plant transcription Factor results in the direct activation     
45:41     
of Target gene expression in cells adjacent to those in which the transcription Factor was originally     
45:47     
produced so this again you know you might have two cells that are sitting next to one another from different cell     
45:54     
wages but but if they can make these exchanges uh they can be regulated in     
46:00     
the way that you know maybe neighboring cells should be regulated something like that so it doesn't necessarily matter     
46:07     
what their original what their origins in a celline ag were it just matters what's being communicated between the     
46:15     
cells and so you know you can see this in cells where there are a lot of uh     
46:21     
examples of cell cell communication uh a particular     
46:26     
interesting example is the knotted one mutant and Maze knotted one or K1 is a     
46:32     
hobok containing transcription Factor responsible for the maintenance of Meo stem cells in a multi- poent     
46:39     
state uh this uh so sometimes you get     
46:44     
breakage and occasional loss of the dominant noted one this shows that the K1 protein     
46:51     
Expresses ectopically in the veins of a developing maze leaf and acts non uh in     
46:57     
a non-cell autonomous way that can control cell division and the surrounding uh misil and epidermal     
47:04     
layers so this is again an example of a gene where you get this kind of effect     
47:11     
that's uh position dependent or maybe tissue dependent instead of someon in     
47:18     
dependent I saw there was a message in this chat here uh this is these are some     
47:23     
citations here Virginia fo uh I think there five here so these     
47:30     
are again kind of talking about some of these uh works     
47:38     
here okay so yeah this this example is from uh they use a number of examples     
47:44     
from Plants this is an example here an image that shows the movement of a     
47:49     
transcription factor in the meristem through the plasma disat so this is uh     
47:56     
lfy the lfy transcription factor which is in yellow up     
48:04     
here uh let me see uh It produced It produced     
48:10     
by the cells on the L1 layer can travel through the plasma uh plasma desata to influence gene expression in the     
48:16     
underlying layers L2 and L3 of the marem so you can see this is the L1 layer at     
48:22     
the top here this this is the marem here this is the lfy expression in these     
48:28     
cells and you see these uh passage like these kind of lines between the cells in     
48:34     
the upper layer this means that they're able to exchange lfy between those cells     
48:40     
but the for now the lower cells L2 and L3 are blocked you can't have exchange     
48:47     
between cells of different layers so the lfy transcription factor is exchanged     
48:54     
across this upper layer and then so yeah it says uh it can but     
49:02     
it has to travel through through this plasmo desata to influence gene expression in the underlying layers L2     
49:08     
and L3 so you see that L2 and L3 then can be influenced but only through a different mechanism so this is kind of     
49:16     
what they're talking about uh so there's this you know this sort of positional     
49:23     
aspect to this um yeah that's that paper     
49:29     
um actually I don't wonder if the at the end of the paper they talk a little bit about some of these questions open     
49:35     
questions uh yeah so questions as answers will be essential to our     
49:41     
understanding include a over what distances and at what rates D functional proteins traffic     
49:47     
and developing plants so these functional proteins L like say lfy they     
49:53     
traffic in a certain pattern you know what is the sort of the range of the     
49:58     
distance uh the length scale under which they travel and what rate do they     
50:04     
traveling brle there's an interesting H aspect to this and that is     
50:10     
that the cell wall at the middle of the Met marem is very soft yeah and it     
50:17     
gradually gets harder so not only do you get this transcription Factor but you're     
50:24     
also getting propagation of St yeah yeah that's     
50:33     
true um yeah and then so B uh which     
50:38     
directions of movement are permissible for each trafficking Factor so we saw that lfy can be transmitted across L1     
50:46     
and then it could be AC transmitted across L2 and L3 in a semi permeable manner so you know we don't know exactly     
50:55     
what what directions of movement are permissible it might be that it's only permissible in One Direction it might be     
51:01     
like unidirectional uh thing where you have a a concentric circle around the cell and     
51:08     
it just broadcasts out like that that that might be an interesting thing and in fact more generally um people have     
51:16     
studied sort of cell cell communication and we kind of assume that things kind of get broadcast out from a cell so     
51:23     
everything around the cell gets the sign at a certain distance so it might be like you know uh at maybe 10 to 20     
51:32     
microns you might get the signal or maybe five microns but it might be diff uh differential in terms of Direction so     
51:39     
you might get a signal that only goes to the left over the right and you know there might be different length scales     
51:46     
within a single broadcast of this of the signal uh so that that's kind of interesting um that's an interesting     
51:53     
question as well uh C is what are the factors that limit or promote the movement of specific proteins so these     
52:00     
are you know again it could be stiffness it could be other factors that play a role it could be other transcription     
52:07     
factors or could be like migration even can be taken into account so we are     
52:13     
thinking of building a computational model of of lineage independent differentiation you know we might have     
52:19     
to take of course the model of how signals are propagated into account uh     
52:25     
some of the structure of the tissue into account and then maybe the physics of the tissue into     
52:32     
account and then at last and last but not least what are the precise developmental consequences of altering     
52:39     
traffic patterns of transcription factors in meristems and developing organs so what are the precise     
52:46     
developmental consequences meaning what is this actually do in the tissue and if     
52:52     
we knock that out what is the consequence of knocking that mechanism out and so uh that's that's something     
52:59     
that yeah they don't really cover here they just kind of demonstrated     
53:04     
it so if we were to have to rely on Cell dependent differentiation what would     
53:10     
that look like uh the final paper here is this     
53:17     
developmental cell paper single cell resolution of lineage trajectories and the arabidopsis Stato     
53:25     
lineage and developing Leaf so I'll just go through the uh H the graphical     
53:32     
abstract here and kind of talk a little bit about this how what they're getting     
53:37     
at in this study so they ask a question how do you build a leaf and so this is a     
53:43     
cartoon of a leaf and this little black circle is this uh cross-section here     
53:50     
where you get these different cells organized in these layers this is the you know uh kind of     
53:56     
where we we have these different cell types so this is a uh scna model of the     
54:03     
developing Leaf so this is the sequencing study where they do this uh     
54:09     
this multi uh dimensional projection is multi-dimensional reduction of gene     
54:15     
expression and you get these clusters of different cell types by their gene     
54:21     
expression profile so you get these Mis this is these are misop cells in this layer and they correspond to a certain     
54:27     
gene expression profile you get vasculature which is in this layer and     
54:32     
this is gene expression profile over here so they there's some overlap but they're they kind of correspond to these     
54:39     
different layers you get the epidermis or the epidermal cells at the bottom and     
54:44     
at the top as well and you get these different patterns of gene expression so they're actually separable some     
54:50     
epidermal cells Express genes here and some Express genes here and there's some     
54:56     
overlap and expression but the point is is that these different layers Express     
55:02     
different uh Gene have gene expression profiles that are different and you know how do you get to that point so how do     
55:09     
you build a leaf in these different layers these distinct layers and then get the cells to be coordinated in terms     
55:15     
of their gene expression um so this gives us a revised     
55:20     
model of epidermal stratal lineage where you get this uh these differentiated     
55:26     
cell types you get the a pavement cell you get the stamata here which is part     
55:32     
of the cell you there's this uh process by which it kind of goes through I guess     
55:39     
these are two different Pathways uh from involving these different genes and they     
55:45     
result in different uh phenotypes and then this is a functional analysis of extended expression so I     
55:52     
guess this overlapping area here where you get these uh this this sort of     
55:58     
overlapping gene expression you're getting um this whale type epidermis     
56:04     
versus late stage loss of spch so it affects the stomata and this is uh so they're kind     
56:11     
of going through they're looking at the leaf cross-section they're looking at these different layers they're looking     
56:17     
at the gene expression profiles then they're looking at the pathways and how they produce uh developmental out comes     
56:25     
and then they're looking at mutant phenotypes and they're looking at when you have stamata versus no     
56:31     
stata so this is actually pointing to a different paper this is kind of a uh one     
56:37     
of these resource papers they call them and this sites a paper lope anito at all uh     
56:46     
and so that's the actual study this is kind of the in brief um so the question is how do cells build developmentally     
56:53     
flexible organs and then this case we're interested in the stamata and how those can be adapted flexibly and so lopus     
57:02     
Ando at all employ a single cell transcriptomics approach to uncover distinct models of cell differentiation     
57:09     
within a rabid opsis Leaf tissue so these two Pathways or these two modes of cell     
57:15     
differentiation um along with revealing dynamics of cellular programs the     
57:21     
identified underlying cell heterogenity within the epidermal lineage and interrogated new rules for a core     
57:27     
transcriptional regulator how does a plant get along without its static I'm not sure but     
57:36     
that's what they I mean this is a mutant phenotype so it's probably not viable necessarily but yeah um so the     
57:44     
highlights from this are that a distinct models of cell differentiation and     
57:49     
lineage trajectories def find Leaf tissue so we get this uh these lineage     
57:54     
traj cies which are important celf cycle regulator is exhibit distinct yet     
57:59     
overlapping expression profile so that's b um and then so you have these     
58:05     
Regulators that are involved in say forming the stamata they have this overlapping gene expression profile and     
58:12     
this can result in this mutant phenotype C flexible stram lineages     
58:17     
exhibit cell States and exist along Continuum so these strodel lineage cell     
58:23     
States can be you know different in nature they can take different Pathways they can result in different     
58:30     
outcomes and D single cell resolution refin cell fake commitment decisions     
58:35     
that yield Stato so these are you know we can look at single cells and their     
58:41     
gene expression profile and we can actually get into what these fate commitment decisions are so you know     
58:47     
it's not just a matter of blindly following a lineage and having this     
58:52     
deterministic uh expression F this this phite type expressed deterministically     
58:59     
there are these different Pathways that could takeen and decisions that are made by this by the cell so this     
59:05     
is uh you know kind of argues that there's maybe the cell independent some     
59:11     
lineage Independence has a little bit uh more nuanced than we thought just from     
59:17     
the name and so yeah this is uh again in plants so we had some examples three     
59:24     
examples from plants two examples from animals thank you Pocky for joining us     
59:32     
um hope you enjoyed the meeting all right so do we have any     
59:37     
questions or comments I'm not up on plants that     
59:46     
much yeah the caveat here is I don't really know that much about plants     
59:51     
so yeah uh Bradley did you run into anything I'm trying to recall the guy's     
59:57     
name uh guy who worked on the uh development of sunflower patterns you     
1:00:05     
know the seeds are right are in Spirals and they're right     
1:00:10     
uh to the NACI sequence and whatnot yeah uh he died young try to remember     
1:00:22     
that I don't know I didn't run across any in that it at any rate uh I I     
1:00:28     
mentioned it in my book hierarchical genome and uh uh it appeared to me an     
1:00:38     
example of differentiation waves     
1:00:45     
okay yeah I don't I have to look and see if I can find something specifically on     
1:00:52     
that yeah I'd have to dig the book out and then get searching anyway     
1:01:00     
uh actually I might be able to do that give me a second     
1:01:23     
here     
1:01:37     
okay     
1:01:53     
now oh Paul Green Paul Green okay that's his     
1:02:01     
name all     
1:02:23     
right     
1:02:51     
then searching through the book but it's very slow yeah I hit his name I'm try to see if I get a     
1:02:58     
reference     
1:03:08     
yeah oh I've got a paper nearby Sun     
1:03:13     
green uh 1989     
1:03:22     
uh verybody don't have a reference yet     
1:03:34     
okay no no point in Waiting take too long okay well I'll see if I can find     
1:03:40     
something on that report back yeah okay so uh yeah I'll look into     
1:03:48     
that see if I can find it and U report back yeah so yeah that was good     
1:03:54     
uh so thanks for attending and uh talk to you next     
1:04:00     
week okay all right thanks bye bye okay now I'd like     
1:04:06     
to go over a paper on fluid flows in biology which is a nice new paper that     
1:04:11     
came out okay so this paper is called three-dimensional soft streaming uh this     
1:04:16     
paper is on something called viscous streaming especially with respect to the soft bodies of biological organisms so     
1:04:24     
we'll go through this is a very mathematical paper this is from the journal fluid mechanics and so we'll     
1:04:30     
just kind of go through some of the conceptual aspects of this uh one of the the last author on     
1:04:35     
this paper is Matia gazola and this is the website for the gazola lab so this     
1:04:41     
is um they're based at uiu uh in they I think they're in the     
1:04:48     
genomic biology uh building and they're also in uh uh mechanical engineering so     
1:04:56     
this is soft creatures uh this is an example of some of the things that they've worked on soft creatures     
1:05:03     
cyborgs biolocomotion and fluids uh the mind in vitro which I     
1:05:09     
guess is like some of these organoid on a chip things uh viscous streaming which is what we're going to talk about where     
1:05:16     
they have this uh dut in a flu flow field and they're going to talk about     
1:05:22     
that uh well talk a little bit about uh viscous streaming and some of the uses     
1:05:29     
of it so viscous streaming is an efficient rectification mechanism to     
1:05:34     
exploit flow inertia at small scales for a fluid and particle manipulation so this is again uh     
1:05:42     
rectification is we'll talk about what that is it typically entails a fluid     
1:05:48     
vibrating around an immersed solid feature that by concentrating stresses     
1:05:53     
modulat the emergence of steady flows of useful topology so this is where a fluid moves     
1:05:59     
around like some solid feature could be like a soft body which would be an     
1:06:05     
organism like say like for example an organism moving through a water column the fluid is vibrating around     
1:06:12     
it and there's a concentration of stresses during that interaction and it modulates the     
1:06:18     
emergence of steady flows and things that maybe Propel the organism     
1:06:24     
or buffer the organism during like you know during movement or something like     
1:06:30     
that motivated by its relevance in biological and artificial settings characterized by Soft materials recent     
1:06:38     
Studies have theoretically elucidated in two Dimensions the impact of body elasticity on streaming flows so we know     
1:06:46     
that like if we have like a body of a fish going through water it can have an     
1:06:51     
impact on the streaming flow if you have water streaming in One Direction and the fish swimming Upstream there can be     
1:06:58     
interactions between the body itself and the water flow so this is uh we can you     
1:07:06     
know we know that the body the relative elasticity of the body whether it's very soft or very rigid can can be impacted     
1:07:13     
by these streaming flows here we generalize these findings to three dimensions by the minimal case of an     
1:07:20     
immersed soft sphere we first improve the existing solutions for the rigid sphere limit by considering previously     
1:07:27     
unaccounted terms we then enable body compliance which means the sort of the softness of the body exposing a     
1:07:34     
three-dimensional elastic streaming process available even in Stokes flows     
1:07:40     
this is a type of turbulent flow here such effect consistent with two-dimensional analysis but     
1:07:46     
analytically distinct as validated against direct numerical simulations and     
1:07:51     
shown to translate the bodies of complex geom ometry and topology Paving the way for advanced forms of flow     
1:07:58     
control so one of the reasons you might want to use something like this is for maybe like a biobot or a soft robot or     
1:08:06     
something like that so uh this study investigates the     
1:08:11     
effects of body elasticity on three-dimensional viscous streaming viscous streaming which is the sort of     
1:08:18     
the topic of you know what the the hydrodynamic aspect of this is this     
1:08:24     
streaming an inertial phenomena refers to the steady rectified flows that emerge when a fluid oscillates around a     
1:08:31     
localized micro feature so you have an interaction between the flow and something in the flow and there's this     
1:08:38     
fluid oscillation right at that where it hits the feature and there you     
1:08:47     
go all right so viscous streaming an inertial phenomenon refers to the steady     
1:08:52     
rectified flows that emerge when a vis fluid oscillates around a localized micro feature so if you have a pipe and     
1:09:00     
you have flow going through you have local micro features where there's an     
1:09:05     
oscillation of the fluid when it comes into contact with that feature given its ability to remodel     
1:09:12     
surrounding flows over a short time and length scale streaming has been found has found application in multiple     
1:09:18     
aspects of microfluidics from particle manipulation and there are a bunch of     
1:09:24     
citations here and chemical mixing citations here the vesical transport and     
1:09:30     
Lis they are citations there's one citation or two actually two citations here so vesical transport of course is     
1:09:37     
important in cells they transport through the cytoplasm and or you get Lis where you     
1:09:44     
get the cell breaking apart and so these are all important places where this is     
1:09:49     
found recently these multi curvature streaming bodies has expanded the     
1:09:55     
ability to manipulate flows leading to compact robust and tunable devices for     
1:10:00     
filtering and separating both synthetic and biological particles and so this is in a microfluidic chamber where you     
1:10:07     
might sort particles or you might sort things uh chemical compounds or cells     
1:10:13     
and so you can use these kind of uh this sort of streaming viscus streaming to do     
1:10:21     
this so more recently yes motivated by medical and biological applications and     
1:10:26     
building upon past theoretical studies and the citations here the effect of body compliance has been considered and     
1:10:34     
so this is where the object has some sort of compliance or softness or ability to sort of uh absorb a lot of     
1:10:41     
these variations in the flow with one of the best uh one of the studies yielding at the first two dimensional streaming     
1:10:48     
theory for soft cylinders so this citation talks about streaming theory for soft cylinders ERS its major outcome     
1:10:55     
is encapsulated in this equation here where this is this term is the time     
1:11:01     
average Stoke stream ific stream function and     
1:11:06     
R for these two uh variables are the radial and polar coordinates in the     
1:11:11     
cylindrical system so you have this characterization of the cylindrical system and you have this time average     
1:11:18     
Stoke stream function this relation reveals an additional streaming     
1:11:24     
process purely induced by Body elasticity that is available even in Stokes flows where rigid body streaming     
1:11:30     
cannot exist so rigid body streaming is this term here which is this term here     
1:11:35     
so we have uh the streaming additional streaming     
1:11:40     
processes here it's additive to this rigid body streaming     
1:11:46     
here so you see we're assembling this streaming process and we have     
1:11:54     
the coordinate system here and then this is our Stoke stream     
1:12:00     
function in this work we extend this understanding to three dimensions by examining the minimal case of an     
1:12:06     
oscillating soft sphere we first present an improved theoretical solution for the rigid sphere Case by augmenting the     
1:12:13     
derivation of Lane with a previously unaccounted term related to Vortex stretching so they're characterizing our     
1:12:21     
mathematical model they're setting up the equations so there are a lot of equations in this paper but basically     
1:12:27     
this is figure one this is the problem setup you have this threedimensional viscal elastic solid     
1:12:34     
sphere and this has a radius of a with a rigid     
1:12:40     
inclusion uh immersed in a viscous fluid so this viscous fluid here it's immersed     
1:12:45     
inside this this is the radius and this is the elastic solid on the outside and     
1:12:51     
so this is again a three dimension in this study we displ deploy a     
1:12:57     
spherical coordinate system where the radial polar and as a mual coordinates are represented the sphere is exposed to     
1:13:04     
an isolatory flow with the farfield Velocity in the X Direction along the     
1:13:10     
axis of symmetry and then two-dimensional axis symmetric cross-section of the elastic sphere     
1:13:15     
shown here where you can see some of these aspects of it so this is the axis     
1:13:20     
of symmetry along the x-axis and there you     
1:13:29     
go     
1:13:52     
so so this is figure two and this kind of shows a little bit of the elastic sphere     
1:13:59     
and streaming flow response so we have our sphere here and we have our     
1:14:04     
flows and so a through C which are these images up at the top these are the three-dimensional time average     
1:14:12     
Lans uh for this uh model this is the Stoke stream function depicting the     
1:14:17     
streaming response at i m equal 6 with increasing softness so this is where we     
1:14:23     
have we start off with an initial condition and you have increasing softness as you go from a to c uh this     
1:14:29     
is a softer so there the parameters changes as the material gets softer and you can see that this flow changes as     
1:14:36     
well blue orange represent clockwise counterclockwise rotating regions so you     
1:14:41     
can see that the blue and orange represent these different regions of rotation and so then if we go to this     
1:14:48     
figure D here uh this is a description here of     
1:14:53     
normalized DC layer thickness which is the y- axis versus the inverse walmar Le     
1:14:59     
number and this is of course a theoretical prediction so we have a number of different conditions this is     
1:15:06     
the lane uh prediction of Lane 1955 so this was the original uh model that we     
1:15:12     
talked about earlier this is the Riley model in 1966 so this is rigid body     
1:15:17     
Theory from Lane this is rigid body Theory from Riley and so this is what theory predicts and then the empirical     
1:15:25     
observations are below here they're actually uh getting uh a different     
1:15:31     
little bit different result from the theory this is rigid body where uh cow is zero this is elastic body where cow     
1:15:38     
is 0.0125 and as cow increases this     
1:15:43     
function goes lower in an elastic body so uh this is the normalized DC layer     
1:15:49     
thickness it decreases you get this this function that deviates from the original     
1:15:55     
Theory and then finally in figure three we see this extension to complex bodies so this is where we get our Taurus that     
1:16:02     
we have this uh ring that that we can see it's interacting with the flow so     
1:16:07     
you get these vortices that occur along the boundary of this uh Taurus and then     
1:16:13     
you get these full Fields out here that are colored uh so this is an extension     
1:16:18     
to a complex body instead of just the sphere now we have a Taurus that's interacting with the flow here we     
1:16:24     
consider compliance induced streaming in a soft Taurus a complex shape entailing multiple curvatures and distinct     
1:16:30     
topology relative to the sphere numerically simulated time average oian     
1:16:36     
flow topologies for a Taurus of core radius are in cross-sectional radius a     
1:16:41     
with varying body elasticity to cow so cow is the varying body elasticity and so we can see that the     
1:16:48     
Taurus is pinned at the center of its circular cross-section by a rigid toroidal inclusion of radius     
1:16:55     
0.4a all of their physical and simulation parameters are consistent with sphere streaming so you can see     
1:17:01     
that there's a difference here in the way this Taurus behaves versus the sphere so the conclusion uh in summary     
1:17:09     
the study improves existing three-dimensional rigid sphere streaming Theory so this is an improvement upon     
1:17:14     
the theory as we saw in figure two expands it to the case of elastic materials and further corroborates it by     
1:17:21     
means of direct numerical simulations our work reveals in keeping with our previous work on two-dimensional soft     
1:17:27     
cylinders an additional streaming mode accessible through material compliance and available even in Stokes flows it     
1:17:34     
further demonstrates a body elasticity strengthens streaming or enables it at significantly lower frequencies relative     
1:17:41     
to rigid bodies so this is interesting because we can take and this is largely     
1:17:47     
thinking in terms of applications you can design things with a very soft body     
1:17:53     
it has high elasticity and it can interact with a flow in different ways     
1:17:58     
than a rigid object would and so you can exploit the design feature say for something in a micr fluidics context     
1:18:05     
where you want to optimize that process or in some other context and this is not     
1:18:11     
bi you know pure biology or developmental biology we talk about in this group but this is kind of     
1:18:18     
instructive as to like how some of these uh geometries how some of these uh body     
1:18:25     
physics might evolve or might uh you know benefit from certain uh types of     
1:18:32     
differentiation so this is an interesting question that I really have a good application doain for it in say     
1:18:38     
developmental biology right now but it is interesting to think about especially considering that we talked about lineage     
1:18:45     
independent differentiation and we talked about some of the aspects of physics of cell sheets     
1:18:52     
and physics of different tissues on differentiation it maybe guiding differentiation so it's a very     
1:18:59     
interesting question um so they kind of talk a little bit about extending these     
1:19:06     
theoretical insights uh maybe to geometries other than the sphere and so these findings     
1:19:14     
Advance our fundamental understanding of streaming flows with potential implications in both biological and     
1:19:20     
Engineering domains and so again these streaming flows are very important structures in the environment and they     
1:19:26     
can have an effect on biological systems uh very soft bodied systems and     
1:19:32     
otherwise
