hi Bradley Hi how are you Hi me sent me a question about about     
0:07     
about comol comma so um yeah um no I     
0:13     
don't I do not know comma but U no nobody knows     
0:20     
console run into the conclusion yeah anyways I'm uh I'm still fighting with     
0:28     
it I currently I have to get um look at the force and see how it's     
0:35     
applied to my model so I have to have my inputs before I look at my outputs so I     
0:43     
have to find I have to change the inputs too     
0:49     
so yes oh anyway Susan did I send you the stuff     
0:56     
on a Japanese fellow who's working on is spots in     
1:01     
butterflies oh I don't think you did I didn't okay his name is Joi J     
1:08     
oji osaki wait let check okay well     
1:15     
sure I'll check his let's see here we     
1:23     
go anyway I I use chat GPT for my help desk for console     
1:30     
it gives me General um routines to try to find the     
1:39     
exact okay I got it don't     
1:45     
talk I'll put it in the chat     
1:57     
yeah he said Jud there's a famous there's a famous musician there's a famous singer named     
2:03     
Jo G I think it's Jo G Jo     
2:09     
G this     
2:15     
okay any rate he's finding that uh that the eye spots are very     
2:21     
similar to uh what used to be called uh     
2:27     
oh loing the word right now     
2:34     
inducers raised and they seem to be the site of mechanical     
2:41     
waves oh very interesting yeah so while the butterflies forming it's not a the     
2:48     
uh Wing this isn't the wings the wings are not flat they actually have raised     
2:57     
points um oh well if you have more information i' like to see that okay     
3:05     
he's got a lot of papers already published on it and he's put some poor student on trying     
3:11     
to get uh Wayne brin's program on hey dick how well is how well is butterfly     
3:17     
Aviation understood how about what how well is butterfly Aviation understood     
3:23     
Aviation I have no idea there's how how butterflies PL yeah do     
3:30     
we how well do we understand that I don't know I saw I saw a very good uh uh     
3:35     
video on uh how bum fly but yeah the     
3:40     
bees are getting all the attention yeah they're getting all the attention Aviation butterfly flights yeah it     
3:48     
didn't mention butterflies so I there's a lot of     
3:53     
attention to other insects um other other flying insects like like bees um     
3:59     
like bees particular like honey bees maybe like like flies definitely butterflies I'm not so sure I've never     
4:05     
looked for butterflies oh yeah I know I know a guy who gets to uh hold the fly and then show it a     
4:13     
display to that he he'd uh he'd take electric signals off its brain yeah     
4:20     
that's what Robert AER and William Bill down I where I did my they used to do that     
4:26     
they put the this guy died young anything in the canoe accident oh     
4:33     
goodness we're talking about the 60s     
4:38     
here I know that they have a a lot of work on mods and like how they respond     
4:45     
to different stimul and how they fly so they can track plumes and then they     
4:50     
watch the mods on camera and track the kinematics so that's that's the closest     
4:57     
I've ever heard of the they also have uh uh Maneuvers to try to avoid uh uh     
5:04     
things like bats yeah because they fly at night and so do     
5:12     
the bats yeah that makes it really hard to study yeah during the summer we F the     
5:18     
bats are because we have outdoor lights that are triggered by motion yeah     
5:26     
yeah all right well all right yeah so let's welcome to the meeting uh it's     
5:33     
like we have Hussein and Dick and Susan and mahul and Pocky and Morgan     
5:40     
hello uh so yeah this is uh first week of Google summer of code the coding     
5:45     
period so we've had the uh Community period for the last     
5:50     
couple weeks and now we're getting into the coding period and that starts today so uh let me go over the schedule     
5:58     
for oops let me go over the schedule for summer of     
6:04     
code and see where we are with that so we had our community period and today     
6:12     
May 27th coding officially begins and so you know we're going to have I think two     
6:18     
evaluations over the summer um we're going to have July 8th and going to     
6:24     
submit an uh an evaluation for both Pocky and mahul     
6:30     
and that's July 12th is the first one and then the second one is I     
6:35     
think uh well maybe only one during the work period but there is also the sort     
6:42     
of the end of the program August 26 through September 2nd and I'll submit a     
6:47     
an evaluation then too so the way this works is that we go through from May     
6:54     
27th to August 26th to September 2nd actually you I think the deadline is     
7:01     
August 26th for student um projects so     
7:06     
what we'll do is will work through the summer for May 27th to August 26th and     
7:12     
then that's the deadline for submitting projects and so as students you have to     
7:18     
submit your own projects package your code and then submit a link to Google and they have to     
7:26     
run the program and test it to see if it runs and then you pass but then I also have     
7:32     
to evaluate you a second time to ensure that you know you did sufficient work     
7:38     
and so that whole process will end in September 2nd um now you can actually extend your     
7:44     
timeline if you need to uh you know if something hap something comes up during the summer uh you'll need maybe need to     
7:52     
extend it a little bit so you can extend it anywhere from September 3rd to November 4th so in the years past we've     
8:00     
had people extend their projects out to the maximum which is November 4th and um     
8:07     
you know it's it's possible to do I I don't know if i' plan for it um but you     
8:13     
know you can basically have an extension I just have to let the people in incf know that we're going to extend it but     
8:20     
otherwise I'll be evaluating your twice you'll be evaluated in July and then in     
8:26     
August and basically those are very easy to pass um I just tell them you know that you've     
8:32     
been doing good work if you course hopefully you've been doing good work all the the whole time I expect you to     
8:38     
and then um you know I'll just uh fill out the form and submit it and um you     
8:45     
know that's good so yeah that's that's how the program will work you know we um     
8:53     
yeah Hussein says I can attest Bradley is great with feedback and responsiveness yeah yeah Hussein was a     
9:00     
gck student in 2022 um so yeah he knows kind know the     
9:05     
process and how it works and everything that you need to do so you know there     
9:12     
are a couple things that you should keep in mind before we start the coding period so the first one is is that I     
9:19     
have um set up a repository and that is in the Devo learn     
9:27     
site so I'm going to put in     
9:37     
I'm going to put in a link and this is going to be our     
9:45     
repository so this is our repository here Devo graph okay     
9:52     
yeah so this is our repository here Devo graph uh uh at Friday's open source     
9:58     
meeting talked about this a little bit but basically both mahul and Pocky will     
10:04     
be submitting to this repository so we have a number of uh directories in this     
10:11     
repository stage one stage two and stage three and those refer to the different     
10:17     
stages of the project so stage one is uh like cell segmentation and we have some materials     
10:24     
from contributors past here but this is basically we have things related to the     
10:30     
cell tracking challenge which is a data set you can use uh there's some things related to mask     
10:36     
segmentation and then there's some stuff here as well where you know you're if you want to use one of the dvo learn uh     
10:44     
toolboxes for uh segmentation you can and all those things are kind of in this     
10:50     
it the discussion for that some files for that are in this     
10:55     
area stage two is building breef and beddings and so that has been there hasn't been as much work done on that we     
11:01     
have a couple of uh uh you know python notebooks here where you can download     
11:09     
them and walk through them you can do whatever you want to do there I expect that this is going to be improved over     
11:15     
the summer but we'll see how that goes and then stage three is uh uh sort of     
11:22     
the back end of what we want to do with the graph inventives so um hansu last     
11:28     
summer worked on uh topological data analysis and so this is a lot of the     
11:35     
work that he did where he has some notebooks here uh he set up an environment and he has this is the read     
11:42     
me here read me doesn't have a lot but it's basically tells you how to run the environment     
11:49     
file and that sort of thing so we have a lot of gaps that need to be filled and     
11:54     
of course you have your projects so I wouldn't necessarily necessarily put     
12:00     
them in stage one stage two and stage three unless they kind of fit into that you can create your own directory so     
12:07     
what I would do is Fork this repository so we already have nine Forks you Fork it and then you know you go through and     
12:14     
you kind of create your own space for what you're doing so if you're doing hyper graphs you would say     
12:20     
hypergraphs or you might put some of your work in stage two or stage three I     
12:25     
see that Pocky already uh uh issued a p request so I accepted that earlier this     
12:32     
morning so thank you for that contribution if you're working on     
12:37     
something else you know you might create a directory for that so you know we'll try to keep this     
12:43     
uh you know coordinated we'll try to make sure maybe we'll even try to improve the repository this summer     
12:50     
because it is kind of a hard thing to kind of get to or get your head around because we've had a lot of     
12:57     
contributors and uh you know it's just kind of it's kind of hard to keep     
13:02     
everything organized when you have contributors coming into the repository making P re quests working on different     
13:10     
stages of a project and this is something that we'll talk about in the open source meetings as well because we     
13:16     
have a lot of uh you know between myself and Jesse and of course Morgan even we     
13:23     
have a lot of experience with these sorts of things thinking about them so that's um that's where we are with     
13:31     
Google summer of code and so welcome to the coding period and I you know I kind     
13:36     
of expect you to make weekly uh pushes to the     
13:41     
repository basically there's no rule about that but basically I want you to     
13:46     
keep everything up to date I don't want things on your local computer and I want to be able to you know track your     
13:53     
progress you'll give a progress report either in this meeting or in a Friday meeting it's up to you     
14:00     
um and then you know we can uh you know just I can maintain your pro or I can     
14:05     
monitor your progress it can help you maintain your your sort of momentum and     
14:11     
if you have problems you know of course we'll be able to discuss those in the slack during the week so you don't have     
14:18     
to wait until Monday to discuss something you can do it um you know as     
14:25     
soon as the problem happens and then we can talk about a debug things if you have to you know change this your     
14:31     
schedule if you have to modify your schedule then that's something we can talk about as well because that happens     
14:38     
a lot during the coding period sometimes people need to recope their projects     
14:44     
sometimes they need to change direction and that's po that's perfectly okay the     
14:49     
whole point of gso is to teach you how to run through a project from you know     
14:55     
the beginning to some stopping point and then submit some some sort of work product and then of course you'll do     
15:01     
things along the way that make you know all of that happen you'll learn all the steps um so one of those steps of course     
15:09     
is generating code but your code is you know maybe secondary to what you're     
15:15     
actually trying to do in your workflow and your uh schedule so you know try to     
15:21     
do a certain amount of stuff each week generate some code uh or you know     
15:26     
Implement something pushes to the repository weekly and then     
15:32     
of course we want to be able to document things so I would have some sort of I     
15:38     
would develop some sort of workflow for documentation whether that be you know having notes that are organized or you     
15:45     
know committing something in the repository that's like a readme file and just kind of putting things in and then     
15:52     
you know keep you know revising and updating it and then at the end of the summer you might do a a final revision     
16:01     
and have that there for people who might come to the repository next year and want to know what you're doing because     
16:07     
that's something that we've of course it's aspirational every year and every     
16:12     
year people fall short because it's not the main purpose of gsaw and that     
16:18     
happens in a lot of projects it's not just people uh you know there there's no     
16:24     
magic bullet to making perfect documentation you might find some reading online that talk about it but no     
16:31     
one's figured that out but that's an important step in this whole process is to keep your keep notes of what you're     
16:37     
doing make sure that you have like a sort of a chain of action so if I you     
16:44     
know do some things over the course of a week you want to document that but you also want to make it so that people can     
16:51     
reproduce what you did so at the end of the summary you'll have this software that you know you'll want people to be     
16:58     
able to run or be able to figure out what's in your repository and you want to make notes as     
17:03     
to what those things are how they work how they fit together um and that that's you know     
17:09     
like we saw with haman's documentation he gives you some instructions on how to     
17:15     
run the software and that's something one thing you can do you can also create     
17:20     
a Jupiter notebook or a collab notebook where you you know have your kernels and     
17:26     
you have the code but you also have uh uh you know annotations in the code that     
17:32     
say what it does and that's why notebooks exist because we can put the     
17:38     
code in these kernels but we can have we can run the pieces separately and then     
17:43     
like say what the pieces do so you don't just run code in in a compiler and not     
17:51     
see what's going on you can interact with it you can just say okay there are 10 lines of code this does this thing it     
17:59     
outputs this graph I'll run it and then it'll show the output and so that's a     
18:06     
that's a nice way to walk people through some of the things you're doing but it doesn't you know it's not the only thing     
18:11     
we want to do we want to have a an executable at the end of the summer ideally although the rules in in on     
18:18     
summer of code are such that you don't have to do it that way but for this in this case that might be a good sort of     
18:25     
stopping point so you know there are a lot of things we can do with uh uh our software     
18:32     
we can do things with um you know changing our schedule things like that     
18:39     
so uh just keep up to date with uh the things that you want to do if you want     
18:44     
to change direction let me know immediately um if you know there's there     
18:49     
are things you you've kind of discovered that you want to explore more you can do so but keep in mind you're on a schedule     
18:56     
and the schedule is is pretty tight and the whole point again of the project     
19:01     
or of the program is to get you from a starting or like a starting a project to     
19:08     
some sort of stopping point in a certain amount of time and only extend your     
19:14     
project if you can't make that end point or that stopping point because you could     
19:20     
do you know you could do your project forever if you if you really wanted to a     
19:25     
lot of projects just continue on and on and that's fine EX except that they're trying to teach you how to make you know     
19:32     
get it find a good stopping point and uh submit a work product because if you you     
19:38     
know when you go into wherever you're going industry Academia those are that's     
19:43     
something you're going to do all the time you're going to have a a finite length project and the point isn't to     
19:51     
like discover all these new wonderful things the point is to just find out     
19:56     
some a couple of things or produce a demo or something and you know report on     
20:02     
it so that's that's what the goal of the project is so any questions about     
20:16     
that okay yeah so some M said thanks yeah again it     
20:23     
you know we'll yeah we'll go through weekly we'll get like you know I'll I'll     
20:29     
give you some time to kind of walk through what you've done over the week and then I'll you know we'll ask     
20:34     
questions about it and it'll be it'll be a pretty good summer hopefully um     
20:44     
yeah okay so did anyone have any updates on their     
20:50     
own projects that you wanted to talk about     
21:00     
hey so I'm not participating in a gof I'm not a I'm not a gsaw concern so I've already spoken with several people here     
21:06     
already a few times on the breast cancer CT the uh excuse me excuse me the uh the     
21:13     
breast cancer computed tography approach I'm working under with [Music]     
21:19     
Dior and and I meet once a week already so we have our one-on-one meetings but uh ultimately um ultimately uh so this     
21:28     
this is my okay excuse me this this is my project in which we're taking these     
21:33     
ADV advancements in next phace technology and um using it to effectively manage and     
21:40     
manipulate manage and manipulate how weal them more     
21:47     
matter um excuse me how we can steer them in a more Dynamic matter um by     
21:52     
studying um by enhancing the Precision of XR computer tomography using JIS sphere at     
22:00     
least but overall we're more so concerned with more efficient effective Ai and ml approaches to controlling and     
22:05     
steering xpl beams for more Dynamic adjustments and um ultimately we want to use these um these particles called     
22:12     
Janis spares that can give us a lot more control over the direction of X-ray photons and give us much higher     
22:18     
resolution images to reduce the dosage of say radiations which breast cancer patients might be exposed to and um you     
22:25     
know see if we can potentially overcome some challenges such as say like how devices like microscopic scales you know     
22:32     
like how how that can be managed in the concept of like the scales of devices themselves or um you know like I it's     
22:40     
really interesting because Di and I do meet together and discuss the papers and the research uh what's being published     
22:46     
even nowadays pretty pretty frequently like in narot technology Material Science chemical physics pushing the     
22:51     
boundaries of what's possible to basically refine the um an x-ray commuted x-ray     
22:58     
computer tomography approach which we have which scientists have more or less been dancing around the question for a     
23:04     
century now and we're getting to this today in 2024 um yeah yeah so there's my     
23:12     
update all right that's good um thank you yeah you've talked about this a couple times and yeah so a Janis spere     
23:21     
for people who don't know what that is could you describe it or yeah I'm definely uh I just thought     
23:28     
good like the the JIS particles are a special type of Nano partic or like either either a nano particle or a     
23:34     
microparticle so they can vary in size from the Nanos scale or to which is the micros scale which is quite a bit bigger     
23:41     
gen in generally we in general we talk we call something a JIS partical when they're two when they have two I believe     
23:47     
it's like like two different distinct physical properties so you could think of like one half of it being hydrophilic     
23:54     
and the other half being hydrophobic um similar to like you know what might Maybe you guys have very go like     
23:59     
chemistry classes when it's like um oil and water that don't um don't quite mix     
24:04     
together they they're nonsoluble um I believe that's what it was it's been a long time since I've studied chemistry so um yeah named after the Roman god     
24:12     
Janice um who was two-faced and they would say he'll be able to look to the Future and to the present and that's     
24:19     
where the month of January comes from too like January being like the Shi from one year to the other um so that's kind     
24:27     
of interesting look up look the Roman Roman god uh Roman God Janus Roman God Janus and he is uh twoof faced the god     
24:34     
of the New Year seeing the past and the future seeing beginnings and ends seeing     
24:40     
um the present and you know I guess uh what's no longer present either you know     
24:46     
so whatever sort of dichotomy you can really take advantage of it's really um it really Ro back that principles from     
24:51     
ancient Greek and R meos and that's really fascinating in a cultural perspec so yeah anyways um Janice particles     
24:59     
that's what they are like um like um like nanoparticles microp particles with two distinct spheres and we are taking     
25:05     
advantage of 3D software too like blender which we we did blender but I moved it over to Unreal because unreal     
25:11     
just offers a lot more functional so blender is pretty cool you can you     
25:16     
can easily just add spheres with a click of a button you just click a button you add a sphere as a blender it's so in     
25:22     
but's the animation software yeah there yeah that's great um so yeah it be     
25:30     
interesting both from like a uh sort of a Imaging perspective but also from like     
25:36     
what you can do in blender and unreal in that 3D space and modeling the stuff     
25:41     
yeah I was wondering if blender might uh work better than console oh hell hell     
25:47     
yeah of course but um so bend with you could do physic simulations in M you that is true     
25:54     
you can actually use scripting in Python and C++ to just even simulate things as they trajectories of beams for x-ray     
25:59     
technology um but unreal offers a lot more functionality unreal is another     
26:05     
like 3D engine for um Graphics processing for game developments and things like that so     
26:11     
yeah does it give you um enough information so that you could build a     
26:17     
bridge so it doesn't fall down like is it a um software     
26:22     
that's mechanically sound um mechanically Okay so     
26:29     
physics from a physics point of view yes from a for the most part yeah um I mean     
26:34     
it's okay look it's interesting it has its own set of physics it's not the perfect physics of what we talk about in     
26:40     
the real book it's all simulated like you can actually recreate like the double slit experiment for one thing and     
26:45     
it doesn't give you the results you should look for you know that's kind of funny but like mechanically though okay     
26:51     
you give it the physics that you want to see that's the thing right and it based off it was it it works based off of an     
26:57     
engine that you yourself can function and program yourself like I can add my own chemical properties to like if I     
27:03     
want to create a bridge like as you describe like a p% yeah and test how     
27:09     
it's going to um you know like how how would these materials respond in a     
27:14     
different condition a weather condition it's very very adverse you know you can actually simulate that you can simulate     
27:19     
that and for the most part I believe it's pretty sound BL blender is too I know blender is used I think it's been     
27:25     
used in forensics but don't quote me on that like certain yeah yeah I've heard of that yeah unreal um see the thing is     
27:34     
unreal has a lot more functionality but with that comes the um you know the the     
27:40     
copat of how true to like like reality how true to the Norms of like Pro     
27:46     
application you're really willing to stay stand so like that's why for example with this project with breast     
27:51     
cancer breast cancer computed demography approaches we need to understand say the capabilities of medical devices like um     
27:58     
you know they're involved in the X-ray Technologies themselves to what extent can they be used in simulating those things too so you     
28:06     
know it's not going to do any good to the hospitals and Manufacturing uh plants if I have a solution that's not     
28:12     
um feasible so have you heard of Ryan osis     
28:18     
too Ryan osis and grasshopper no wait did you wait you did     
28:24     
not just say whyos why yes rhinoceros yeah there's a rhinoceros     
28:31     
software I have it actually oh it's a software oh     
28:36     
wow okay you can 10 seties using grasshopper apparently but like Sim to     
28:44     
me from that lab so I don't know I don't also     
28:50     
3D okay I think it's expensive okay okay no I haven't um     
28:58     
um yeah within within science within scientific research um Maya's really     
29:04     
hard May's really hard Maya's pretty well oh Maya's been around a long     
29:10     
time you know like Maya is yeah and it's actually um Maya does cost money as well     
29:17     
so you gota stud yeah anyways um     
29:24     
yeah oh well [Music]     
29:29     
there's a lot of different software out there and um I'm using one that seems to     
29:36     
have no help desk so I keep wondering if I could do something else yeah um well     
29:45     
as to my research I found someone else simulating um epithelial cells so     
29:53     
see yeah I think there it is and     
29:58     
uh they've kind of done a weave of the uh outline of the cell and it's     
30:06     
produced some good results so now I get to uh relate my model to this     
30:12     
model yeah yeah I I don't know what software they     
30:18     
were using they you know papers they just don't say what software they're using right yeah yeah yeah I think it's     
30:27     
um you know I mean regardless like whether you want to simulate with with blender     
30:33     
my it's good to be you know good across different software like the the software is the software right what matters is     
30:39     
like is what you're producing sound is it valid is it reproducible you know um within the constraints of these um like     
30:46     
simulations like blender having its own capacity for Python scripts that's all you really need you can give the Pyon SC     
30:52     
itself and sure that whatever happens in your simulation is valid itself you know like you don't have to be so     
30:58     
that um like oh is this software like blenda unreal is it like going to     
31:04     
translate into Real Results what if you can script it in Python you can show that there then that's what yeah that's what matters so um what they although um     
31:13     
you know like uh excuse me um I think     
31:21     
um well I think I think I think trans translating the results though from simulations from the     
31:26     
software into real world practical applications there's still there some like like like I don't know it's um it's     
31:33     
more so it's more so like like like because like let's say like whether I'm doing it with blender it's like oh blender is not really working out so     
31:39     
much can I switch over to Unreal um you know like the more you can take advantage of like the more you yourself     
31:46     
can control within those environments that's also what helps too so you know well commo comes complete with the the     
31:55     
physics um okay like it's fine element analysis physics so um yeah and tensity     
32:04     
doesn't quite fit with it it's not exact it's just any     
32:14     
yeah yeah that's great um yeah looks interesting the the     
32:20     
multiscale paper here uh so D static and     
32:25     
dynamic mechanics of cell monol layers a multiscale structural model so looks     
32:32     
interesting yeah it has well it has some good quotes for me in it and um I'm only     
32:39     
going to do half of what they were trying to do with their model so we'll see I'll do that half and then maybe     
32:46     
I'll get told no do the rest I get get ordered     
32:53     
around no do all that     
32:59     
yeah yeah yeah I can hear it happening already but I gotta do the first part     
33:05     
first the static analysis first yeah     
33:12     
yeah oh well so that's my project I'm still I have to look at inputs this week     
33:19     
okay find out actually what's going on with the end uh did we have any other updates     
33:25     
from anyone much like there's also been this shift towards unreal as well too towards unreal and Maya part of a lot of     
33:33     
companies shifting away you about a year and a half ago     
33:39     
there was this big CEO of unity yeah and the company um so like that that was     
33:47     
that was difficult because Unity used to be something we'd all learn for development and and so there's there     
33:52     
shifts away from it but there was like this they they made some very poor business decisions I'll     
34:00     
so yeah so okay so I'm gonna go to uh a paper     
34:08     
and uh this is something that dick sent U so this one is actually on celegans     
34:15     
and so they'll what they're trying to do in this paper is they're looking they're using this technique to look at cell     
34:22     
specific proteomics and interactomics and they'll talk about what that is here     
34:29     
and they're using a specific marker to sort of get at or     
34:35     
classify different types of cells like well we'll see what they're doing here so um let me zoom in     
34:52     
here so this paper is ma Mac SPI or max speed     
34:58     
enables tissue selective proteomic and interactomic analyses the multicellular     
35:04     
organisms so they're using that they're using this method to discover tissue     
35:10     
selective uh markers and they're looking at this in C Elegance so uh let's take a     
35:19     
look at this uh the abstract reads multicellular organisms are composed of     
35:25     
many tissue types have distinct morph I Oles and functions which are largely     
35:30     
driven by specialized proteom and interactomes so you know one of the things we've been interested in this     
35:36     
group is differentiation and building differentiation trees and so you know     
35:42     
the question is is how do we make those determinations using what markers you     
35:49     
can look at the phenotype of a cell and you can tell whether something is differentiated so for example you can     
35:56     
look at a stem cell you can look at a neuron or maybe some epithelial cell and     
36:01     
you see differences between them and we have you know we can characterize the shape of the cell in say a microscopy     
36:09     
image and we can determine when that differentiation happened and under what     
36:16     
conditions um you can also look at the molecular markers which are harder because you know we don't have a good     
36:22     
recipe for you know everything every change that goes into making     
36:28     
say an epithelial cell we know the markers the candidate markers but it's hard to know under what     
36:36     
conditions that transition actually happens what are the precursors and so     
36:41     
forth so in the literature they have candidate genes candidate proteins but beyond that we don't really know what to     
36:49     
look at and what the thresholds of expression are to know what you know what defines the differentiation of it     
36:57     
so you know we're working on a paper along those lines and it's pretty hard to determine but what they're doing here     
37:04     
is they're using a a a new technique so     
37:09     
they're developing this localized proteomics approach methionine analog     
37:14     
based cell specific proteomics and interactomics or maxby and so that's the     
37:22     
uh acronym is in reference to uh this method uses the tissue specific EXP     
37:27     
expression of an engineered uh methonal TRNA synthetase label proteins and so     
37:35     
the methal TRNA synthetase is a biomolecule it's engineered for this     
37:41     
specific P purpose the purposes to label proteins with a bifunctional amino     
37:47     
acid in selected cells so you're basically engineering A protein that     
37:52     
will Express in specific types of cells it's easy to     
37:57     
uh recognize when that's being expressed and so it's easy to use as a marker so     
38:04     
whenever it's expressed we say that's our marker that's where we determine whether this has been expressed or not     
38:11     
and then we can you know look at a microscopy image see where the markers expressed we can get spatial information     
38:17     
temporal information and all of that we applied Max B and     
38:25     
celegans uh a model multicellular organism to selectively label capture     
38:30     
and profile the proteomes of the body wall muscle and the nervous system so if     
38:36     
you're not familiar with the seelan morphology in the adult or even in the     
38:42     
in the larva worms you have body wall muscle which is along the walls of the body It's usually the muscle tissue     
38:49     
there not the epithelial tissue uh and then the nervous system which is of     
38:54     
course all the neurons you know both in the central nervous system there's some neur neurons in the tail and some     
39:02     
nervous system cells along the lateral line of this of the worm so um this is     
39:08     
what they're profiling so they're not profiling every cell they're just looking at body wall muscle and the     
39:13     
nervous system so they're looking at the proteomes of these cells and we know all     
39:20     
of the cells in the morphology of seans that's what open Norm is all about and     
39:26     
so there just taking a small small subset of those cells and looking at the proteum profile now in doing so they     
39:34     
lead it leads them to the identification of tissue specific proteins so you can     
39:40     
use these markers to S select cells you can also identify tissue specific     
39:46     
proteins because these are specific types of cells these are muscle cells neurons and muscle cells and neurons are     
39:54     
closely Linked In terms of their composition so they're not the same cell     
40:01     
uh but you know they they have like similar markers they're both kind of     
40:08     
citable C cell types so you know this is restricting it to that as opposed to     
40:14     
looking at germ cells or U epithelial cells can help because you're not you     
40:20     
know your profile is uh restricted so this is what they're doing with this     
40:26     
method using the photocross Linker which is a way that they uh deter able to     
40:32     
identify proteins and and um do things like that we successfully profiled hsp90     
40:39     
interactors and muscles and neurons and I'll talk about hsp90 in a minute and     
40:46     
identify tissue specific interactors and stress related interactors so what they're trying to do     
40:52     
is they're trying to get a sense of what proteins are interacting under certain     
40:57     
condition and of course if you go into the literature on molecular biology you know     
41:03     
we're all familiar with genes and gene expression and that genes make proteins     
41:08     
and that multiple genes make single proteins and that proteins can be modified transcripts can be modified so     
41:15     
there's all this complexity but then you have these interactions so when Pro once proteins     
41:22     
are formed they interact they you know uh and you have to kind of UNT disentangle those     
41:29     
interactions to understand what the proteins do and you know what their abundances mean in terms of function so     
41:37     
this is something that you know happens in certain contexts of the organism so     
41:44     
you know sometimes we have t very specific interactions related to tissue     
41:50     
type so in muscle cells or neurons or even in epithelial cells we have     
41:55     
specific interacting uh proteins we have specific interactions that occur and     
42:01     
then we have things that are related to function and so there's you know the     
42:07     
stress response is very common in organisms it involves a lot of proteins     
42:12     
and so that but that's something that's somewhat well-characterized so we can look at stress related interactors as     
42:18     
well and if there's a stress response in the organism it could be due you know we     
42:23     
think about stress we think about like you know uh if you're under stress psychological stress uh mechanical     
42:31     
stress but in biology there's a lot of like stress related stuff that happens     
42:36     
whenever the organism is maybe undergoing a change or it's challenged by its environment so if it's in a uh     
42:44     
you know there's something called heat shock which is where the organism is exposed to a high level of heat uh and     
42:51     
you know especially in development that can trigger a lot of these stress Pathways and so     
42:58     
that's that's an an important thing to look at because it facilitates a lot of changes that otherwise you wouldn't be     
43:03     
able to observe our study demonstrates that Max B can be used to profile tissue specific     
43:09     
proteomes and interactomes and intact multicellular organisms and so they're using     
43:15     
celegans as a way to sort of characterize this we know the cells we     
43:20     
know what they do and we know the sort of the U the stress related response     
43:27     
now there's this thing called hsp90 and this is the Wikipedia page for     
43:33     
hsp90 so as I mentioned before you know we're interested in the stress response is sort of a perturbation of the tissue     
43:41     
or of the developmental system and this is a well characterized uh what they     
43:47     
call chaperone protein and so uh so heat shock protein 90 as we said heat shock     
43:54     
is a a form of uh perturbation a form of this sort of stress     
44:00     
response uh if you expose an embryo to heat uh or an organism to heat over a     
44:06     
long period of time you know it'll challenge the organism's physiology and     
44:12     
their physiology will respond in kind so in yeast in in seans in gropel you'll     
44:18     
see this heat shock response sorry you get heat chock     
44:24     
proteins uh expressed due to alcohol um and microgravity um so other things uh     
44:33     
cause it to be expressed oh yeah yeah and there are other heat shock protein     
44:39     
besides hsp90 this is just the one that they focus on with these like heat shock     
44:45     
experiments so yeah stress is like you know you can have like you can expose an     
44:52     
organism to all sorts of things uh and you can exhibit a similar     
44:57     
response so it exhibits a similar response so yeah there they're the     
45:03     
chaperon proteins that are involved in sort of assisting other proteins to fold     
45:09     
or unfold so this this is an example of these kind of interactions that are occurring in the proteome there's the     
45:15     
chaperon protein that moves with another protein to help it fold and if you     
45:21     
express it in different amounts it can facilitate or hinder that response or     
45:27     
that set of interactions so if you have a heat shock hsp90 is it uh you know assisting     
45:35     
proteins to fold or not fold if it's there not there you know it can't do its     
45:40     
job or it can do its job more effectively so uh they you know they     
45:46     
they help proteins fold properly stabilize proteins against heat stress so when hsp90 is there proteins can fold     
45:54     
properly even in the face of this heat shock and then also it helps clear Pro     
46:00     
old proteins that need to be degraded if you know about one of the hypotheses     
46:05     
about um neurod degeneration uh you know they there     
46:11     
sometimes you know you have problems with uh degrading old proteins and so this is a problem um that that hsp90 can     
46:20     
help with as well uh so this is why you know people have explored the system     
46:25     
quite a bit um and so this is basically talks about heat shock proteins so     
46:31     
there's a class of these kind of proteins they're the most highly express cellular proteins across all     
46:37     
species um and they account for 1 to 2% of total to total protein and unstressed     
46:44     
cells however when cells are heated the fraction of heat shock proteins increases to 4% four to 6% of cell     
46:52     
proteins so you can see if you induce this heat shock that you get a lot more these type of proteins and you know this     
46:59     
is interesting because you know when we talk about differentiation is differentiation in a     
47:06     
sense maybe or is it maybe induced by a stress-like event or a heat shock event     
47:13     
or something like that so in other words when you have this kind of response does it uh enhance differentiation or does it     
47:21     
trigger differentiation or do you know or is differentiation just simply     
47:27     
something that isn't involving these kinds of changes in these in something like a heat Shar     
47:33     
protein um so I mean you know it's it's it's an interesting thing I know that like people have done experiments where     
47:41     
they've looked at differentiation being induced under certain conditions uh so     
47:47     
we know for example in cancer cells that they uh differentiate down a cancer     
47:53     
pathway in stressful environments that stressful environments can trigger those     
47:59     
events so it's an interesting point to kind of think about this relationship between these kinds of uh protein     
48:07     
protein interactions and differentiation whether the differentiation is sort of normal like you would see in uh     
48:15     
development or whether it's abnormal like a cancer going down a cancer pathway or an aptic pathway where the     
48:22     
cells die prematurely and and I guess it would be a necrotic pathway     
48:28     
but um so yeah so yeah they they've done a lot of this experiments with this type of     
48:35     
thing uh but I wanted to mention that as context for this paper     
48:41     
so what is the significance of this uh so multicellular organisms synthesize a     
48:48     
specific set of proteins in each cell type to enable cellular differentiation     
48:54     
and functions these proteins interact with each other to form complexes and     
48:59     
this is needed for various cellular processes so as we differentiate from one cell type to another our cell     
49:06     
processes change and the the complement of proteins changes with that so if we     
49:11     
can monitor the proteome and especially these protein protein interactions we can get a better handle on what proteins     
49:18     
are involved in specific cell type differentiation um and so there are very     
49:25     
few methods that can really robustly profile cell specific proteomes we can     
49:31     
profile proteomes and protein protein interactions uh in bulk but getting     
49:36     
these cell specific proteum and understanding the the sort of specific markers involved in say like uh muscle     
49:44     
or neuron or whatever those are a little harder to get at and you have to really     
49:49     
kind of to do that you really have to physically isolate the cells do like single cell analysis and that can be a     
49:56     
problem biologically because it's not in the biological context it's just kind of like you know you have a muscle cell     
50:03     
after it's differentiated you look at the complement of proteins but proteins are very unstable in that though they     
50:09     
don't maintain their uh their profile if you're in context of an organism for     
50:15     
example you have proteins that are responding to not only the cell type but the physiology and everything and when     
50:22     
you take the cell out of that context it can change things quite a bit that's also true expression by the way but um     
50:29     
you know that's a different topic for a different time um so they've developed this chemical biology approach to label     
50:36     
proteins from specific cells um this carries both a biorthogonal tag for Infinity     
50:43     
purification and a photo cross Linker for capturing these     
50:48     
interactions so this is uh so they apply this to seans um and they they they say that     
50:56     
profiling tissue specific proteomes and interactomes is particularly challenging     
51:02     
in small-sized multicellular organisms such as celegans through the difficulties of isolating large numbers     
51:08     
of cells and maintaining the Integrity of cellular structures during the physical isolation so this is where you     
51:16     
know cgans has just under a thousand cells     
51:21     
hermaphrodite and you know cell specific or uh functions specific cells or pH you     
51:29     
know distinct types of cells you have even fewer so you know being able to     
51:34     
profile cells by their cell type is Harden sea Elegance as opposed to something like in humans or mammals     
51:42     
where you have maybe like in the liver where you have a lot of cells of a certain type and then you know they're     
51:48     
being regenerated and so forth so this is definitely harder to do in seans but     
51:54     
we also know exactly what the cells are so you know they have they've developed     
52:00     
this method uh they're able to uh give some results here uh they kind of show     
52:07     
what they're doing here um they have so this is uh where cells are expressing     
52:14     
this wh type met RS and you know they show that it can be you know whether it     
52:20     
can be labeled or not um and this is the phenotype of the     
52:25     
worm so they're doing this in certain cells and they're showing sort of how     
52:31     
this labeling process works that you have the cell cell specific proteomics     
52:37     
you have these cell specific protein protein interactions uh in the cell of interest     
52:43     
and they show a lot of you know like molecular biology here a lot of stains um and they show kind of you know     
52:49     
they do this Val these validation steps where they St things and they kind of look at uh different things being     
52:57     
expressed and different markers so you want to be able to get the right marker you want to be able to get Target the     
53:03     
right cells Target the right signal so that's what they're trying to do here and they actually show some of the     
53:10     
things that they're doing in terms of engineering this uh these markers so you     
53:15     
know they're doing some prote uh protein sequence analysis um and that's what that     
53:25     
is uh uh yeah and so then they show kind of like this result here where they're able     
53:32     
to identify sort of the content of muscle and neurons so they're able to differentiate between the two cell types     
53:39     
and of course there's overlap between the two cell types and you have uh     
53:45     
different genes being expressed in neurons and muscle so you can you have     
53:50     
these uh they're identifying this by Gene uh along for these two cells so so     
53:56     
let's see if I can find the uh in the figure caption here uh so C is a ven     
54:03     
diagram showing the overlap of identified hsp90 interactors from body well muscle and neurons so this is where     
54:11     
in C where we have muscle and neurons where we have unique interactors and then interactors that sort of overlap     
54:19     
between the two cell types not surprisingly since they're you know have some similar uh functions     
54:27     
uh might have a similar profile uh and then D twodimensional scatter plot of     
54:33     
proteins identified and Quantified using this HL ratio and the hsp90 interactomes     
54:39     
for different tissues so these are actually well these are proteins not genes and so they're they identify these     
54:47     
specific protein types in muscle and neuron and they plot it according to     
54:52     
this metric HL um and so you can see that there's some outliers here that     
54:58     
they identify by name and then there's this cluster here around zero so yeah     
55:05     
there it's not you know they have they've been able to identify specific uh markers that are different     
55:12     
proteins that are outside of this cluster so those are one things of interest and so e here is uh goterm     
55:20     
enrichment analysis so that's where they take like a protein and they give it an annotation     
55:26     
so they give it like sort of it's functional uh they they basically have done these they have these go terms     
55:33     
where they have the name of the protein or the name of the Gene and they have like a function attached to it and     
55:39     
they're usually not very specific but they do give you some information about what that protein or Gene does so     
55:46     
they're using these go terms uh of identified proteins from body wall muscle and neurons only     
55:53     
significant P Val uh P value sign ific go terms are shown and so this is sort     
55:59     
of a profile of these uh you know like basically these functions so they they     
56:06     
have these proteins and they have some related function and they're in different parts of the you know     
56:12     
different functional space so for example you have a bunch of go terms related to biological process a bunch of     
56:19     
go terms related to cellular component and a bunch of go terms are related to molecular function and so here in this     
56:26     
part we see that there's this uh P value minus log 10 which shows the     
56:33     
difference between muscles and neurons so you see these types of things expressed in neurons and expressed in     
56:39     
muscles so for example glyco processes expressed in muscle ir1 mediate     
56:45     
unfolding protein response expressed in muscle lipid transport is specific to     
56:51     
neurons and so forth translation of course is specific to both as you might     
56:57     
expect um ribosome is specific to both and you know so on and so forth so you     
57:03     
can get a sense of sort of the functions that are cell specifics based on you     
57:09     
know their their expression and how we can characterize these but to get all     
57:15     
this information we need this sort of uh this marker this this probe that we can     
57:22     
apply to the cells and we can actually get this information     
57:28     
okay so um that's all I think that was a good paper to kind of go over to talk about sort of the complexities of um you     
57:37     
know looking at something like proteomics and cell     
57:42     
differentiation need to need to look more at that that's great though yeah and again     
57:51     
this is just like one like way to do this and the The Innovation here to have like a probe a marker that allows us to     
58:00     
sort of you know make these sort of get at these interactions and where they're     
58:06     
happening and what kinds of things are involved in them so it really kind of     
58:11     
you know pairs down our search space for the things that are relevant to cell     
58:17     
type and so again doesn't tell us about the differentiation process per se but     
58:22     
it does tell us that things that are implicated in cell types you know what are they what is going on in terms of     
58:30     
you know when you have different cell types you know obviously we know that     
58:35     
they have different functions a muscle has a function of moving the organism basically neurons have the function of     
58:42     
sending a signal to the muscle sending a signal to other neurons but then what     
58:47     
are the proteins that are involved what are their functions so that's that's where we're getting an innovation here     
58:57     
excuse me yeah absolutely just how hard that and how     
59:03     
hard it is to you know track all that track all that complexity you     
59:10     
know you know again like kind of just reiterating things about     
59:16     
the you know how how much you can get from structural Imaging about about self     
59:24     
function and physiology you and how important it is to to track     
59:30     
all this this complex protein traction     
59:37     
expression and how Dynamic it is yeah definitely and this is just a     
59:45     
snapshot yeah yeah yeah this is just a snapshot the um I I I posted a a paper     
59:53     
protocol from Alison in uh brain organoids okay and it's talking     
1:00:03     
about um so one it's just nice to see a protocol from     
1:00:08     
him and two he he calls it a semi guided protocol and what he's saying is it's a     
1:00:16     
protocol to to generate his kind of electrophysiological     
1:00:23     
oscillations um organoid and he's he's talking about the the     
1:00:30     
difference between the the unguided and the guided you know like yeah having     
1:00:36     
having some some guidance um which you know is just some of the some of the     
1:00:43     
chemical baths that you're using right and and how yeah just how that's that's     
1:00:52     
changing giving that extra that extra you know those extra differentiation     
1:00:58     
signals and um it would be great to see you know like how how to capture how     
1:01:06     
those cells are different now yeah in terms of this this semi-guided and and and hence they're     
1:01:14     
they're you know having much more structured     
1:01:19     
electrophysiology yeah it's it's this you know this kind of promic is is what     
1:01:26     
what you need to you need to match with this this kind of organoid you know     
1:01:32     
these organoid platforms yeah yeah definitely especially like in     
1:01:39     
organoids I mean you're doing a lot of directed differentiation like you're it's very unlike maybe like biology     
1:01:48     
especially if you're introducing stresses and yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean     
1:01:55     
I I still I still like the kind of you know the leaven argument     
1:02:00     
of it's it's all it's all biology yeah but but I I know what you mean and     
1:02:08     
and yeah it's it's what we can it's what we know how to control or what we know how to direct but     
1:02:16     
um yeah yeah but but certainly like you know I I still need help with the you     
1:02:23     
know what are the tools you can use to to capture the you know even even in     
1:02:29     
snapshots to to capture the differences in say the the unguided and     
1:02:39     
guided yeah you know things things that can do more um     
1:02:47     
yeah that can capture me you know more well a wider wider range of of     
1:02:56     
activity or expression     
1:03:02     
right yeah that's and that's the thing is like getting the realistic activity     
1:03:07     
or that wide range of activity you don't I mean you you want methods that allow you to capture that and not have like a     
1:03:14     
very constrictive view of the cell like you know a lot of laboratory methods suffer from that where you have this     
1:03:21     
like I'm going to idealize the conditions and but that's not the way you usually see biology so you're going     
1:03:26     
to end up with with you know a limited subset of the things that are involved     
1:03:32     
so thank you they can come up with some pretty pretty uh pretty quite frankly bizarre conclusions at times if it's     
1:03:39     
overly constrained so yeah yeah apprciate you sharing all this um yeah I would see I seen a a lot of the     
1:03:45     
limitations um particularly with size itself you know like um like and I mean     
1:03:50     
like literally like physical size so you know um yeah yeah     
1:03:57     
yeah okay uh well if that's all for today uh any other things you wanted to     
1:04:02     
say before we go yeah um so I will most likely be     
1:04:08     
moving out to California for my job so for those of you don't work for those you sorry for those of you who don't     
1:04:13     
know I've been working at a um startup which is we're very very close to the     
1:04:18     
stages of no longer being called a startup not going to be called a business I work for this place called alter learning they're based in     
1:04:24     
California and an educational technology startup where we create Steam games for kids to play in VR and we reach out to     
1:04:30     
K12 schools to educate them and this is like the it's going to be a curricula a standard for high schools Across the     
1:04:36     
Nation across the United States for VR games in Steam we've had this company together for years and we're just now     
1:04:41     
getting off the grounds now so um like you know we've been through the ups and downs we've been through the red tape     
1:04:46     
signed up signed on things with the curricula we've been seeing offer some investors and um it's so exciting that I     
1:04:52     
can be part of this like this startup and be part of this really really great you know amazing thing for the United     
1:04:58     
States and for the world moving forward too um and uh yeah we we really have to     
1:05:03     
this is why I've been have to really keep these things like not not I mean I am under NDA but like that's why you know I can't necessarily jump the gun     
1:05:10     
and say you know I'm starting the next apple right now we had to go through the go through everything to make sure everything was through together and for     
1:05:17     
me sitting here in my house here in Indiana I can now move out to um I mean I basically for me to continue as a     
1:05:23     
full-time employee I got to move out to Davis so G be really exciting I'll most likely     
1:05:30     
I'll most likely chose to live in Sacramento so for those of you who are un familiar Sacramento um in Davis are     
1:05:35     
just about 15 like it's it's pretty close 10 miles very close very very close     
1:05:42     
Sacramento and Davis and I'm pretty sure housing is more affordable in Sacramento so that's ultimately why but um yeah     
1:05:47     
they come over based in Davis California and I'll be M up Sacramento to work fulltime and um I only have to commute     
1:05:54     
to the office two days a week and that's going to be pretty D good so um yeah um     
1:06:00     
I'm going to be much happier on the west coast speaking Eng which the Midwest I love the Midwest Indiana and Illinois too where orth is but like I'm more     
1:06:07     
California West so anyways um excuse me um yeah that's some pretty exciting     
1:06:14     
stuff and um speaking of like you know where things could go with um yeah thank you thank you z um where things you know     
1:06:21     
with like what work I could be able to do so that means I could be able to reach out network with anybody on the west Coast um and the West Coast as well     
1:06:28     
so yeah Francisco is still pretty close if you want to know something     
1:06:34     
about the Canadian curriculum I taught High School science and math for 11     
1:06:40     
years yeah yeah so I know the Manitoba curriculum which is different from the     
1:06:47     
other provinces so if you're obviously different from America too you know yes yeah it's similar but things you'd be     
1:06:55     
surprised I mean maybe you wouldn't be surprised but like things depend on political stuff cultural things the Abus and the needs of schools I know what I     
1:07:02     
was taught from the scientific perspect from from science and maths and things I so I went to high school in Indiana um     
1:07:09     
this uh this city here called like Zs of high school and what they would teach like not just scientifically like um in     
1:07:14     
terms of um like what you'd study but how curricular depends on a lot of stuff that um can be um more like I don't know     
1:07:22     
policy tape like red tape based like you know sort of thing things so it's really interesting so to see where things go     
1:07:29     
but um yeah um from a from a tech neurotech biotech perspective I'll be moving over to the West Coast pretty     
1:07:35     
soon so yeah yeah anyway congratulations thank you thank you     
1:07:42     
yeah okay all right thank you see you next week bye bye bye than take care     
Now playing
