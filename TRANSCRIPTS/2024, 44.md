hi Hi how are you uh I don't know I have to give this     
0:06     
it's only half an hour speech all right I has 40 pages 40     
0:15     
slides long but seven of them are just sort of plain titles so it's more or less 30 pages yeah and for some reason     
0:24     
it's giving me a bad time but any I can't really spit out some of the things     
0:29     
that need to say so would you like to see it or some of     
0:35     
yeah some of that would be great try this can you see that yes yes     
0:41     
I can see it you have the entire screen okay um and I'm supposed to be     
0:47     
giving it like this but somehow it cuts off uh University of     
0:53     
Manitoba December 2024 but anyways oh     
1:00     
um any that the title of the whole thing is modeling modeling simple epithelial     
1:08     
epithelium tissue using T tensy structures and you can tell I just not     
1:15     
with this Y and I are not one in a chord okay     
1:22     
so I works there okay so my outline in that     
1:30     
I have an outline so introduction epithelial tissue structure     
1:36     
model build results validation and conclusion okay so this is the     
1:44     
introduction epithelial tissue structure um epithelial tissue comes in     
1:51     
several different types um scham or short cuboidal and calmer which is tall     
1:59     
Strat ified and pseudo stratified and my models are Squamish cuboidal and     
2:06     
cmer and biological tissue is a structure in tension and is it is     
2:12     
considered to be a t structure so this is a stress strain     
2:18     
curve of skin and you can see that when it's relaxed it has an elasticity that is     
2:25     
kind of black and when it is tensioned it     
2:30     
changes um to a larger elasticity when the um structures are aligned     
2:39     
inside and then this is when it breaks so curves like this are going to     
2:45     
be used for the validation portion of my     
2:52     
talk and okay epithelial um     
2:57     
tissue has an actin Bel specture at the top it goes around in a belt around the     
3:05     
uh upper part of the cell     
3:11     
um and it also has a basement membrane and it's attached to the basement     
3:20     
membrane so these are um showing an actin and mein um stress fibers that make up the     
3:28     
belt and it's nonmuscle mein but it still acts like like muscle does and     
3:37     
contract so this is where you get the tension in your     
3:43     
structure in your epithelial     
3:49     
structure and tri Junctions in cells are between the cells you can see them here     
3:56     
in yellow and here in blue they occur at     
4:02     
the vertices in the cells and this is a close-up view of of one or closeup     
4:13     
diagram so epithelial tissue structure has a top ring see the top ring here     
4:21     
yep and then it has Tri Junctions and they're quite     
4:26     
small TR Junctions here and here and here and then it has basement membrane     
4:35     
attachments all along in blue here and sity models are made up of     
4:42     
strings in tension and bars in compression and the whole structure is     
4:48     
is tensioned it'ss so good it works with     
4:53     
soap it works with my skull bar on my mouse anyway so     
5:00     
my model build this is a t310 seg in tension     
5:09     
showing that being ped and this is a T3 being     
5:16     
compressed and these were used for uh the tri Junctions with the posts show     
5:23     
you the post in a minute um and this is a key or um andsy again     
5:33     
showing tension and compression with uh the stress the stress shown in colors so     
5:42     
as it becomes tensioned there's more stress on the strings these are the strings     
5:50     
here and these are the bars and same here these are the strings     
5:56     
and these are the bars and the whole thing is intention     
6:03     
so I I made the um I made this out of hexagon um     
6:09     
tilings and the bottom of the hexagon has the measures of S A and W     
6:17     
and then M and M is the membrane uh distance     
6:24     
because shell membrane okay     
6:29     
cell membrane and then these are the building blocks This Plane attachment     
6:35     
didn't work at all so I I made 10 sity     
6:41     
attachments with strings and in blue in this case and the black as in black is a     
6:51     
bar and when you place these tensity structures in tension they tend to um     
6:59     
curve of it and the same with     
7:06     
compression and this is a hexagon 3D structure um I made it out of two     
7:12     
hexagon Rings a smaller one at the top larger one at the bottom and the     
7:18     
compression um I not compression elements were added in blue so these are     
7:26     
the bars in Blue on the top and bottom     
7:33     
and then this is the three cell structure and in the middle I have this     
7:39     
T4 structure and um attached to these posts I have     
7:47     
the T3 structure and the the um posts are necessary um to hold the structure     
7:54     
up and they can represent the rest of the tissue so this is is only three     
8:02     
cells and here's another view of it you can see that the T4 structure is     
8:09     
quite small the T3 structure is as     
8:16     
well and I made uh three basic     
8:23     
models a cuboidal model Squamish or short model and a colmer or     
8:33     
TMA they all have a spring spring Foundation that you can see in blue so     
8:39     
these are are Springs and I chose a variety of spring     
8:46     
constants from 10,000 uh Newtons per meter to 10 Newtons per meter and that's     
8:55     
quite a large range but uh tissue also has uh a large um large     
9:04     
range of elasticity uh let's see oh I didn't     
9:10     
include the range of elasticity for tissue I need to     
9:16     
find and in order to get the structure to work I had to have pin points so     
9:22     
these are the pin points on the outer part of uh the post     
9:32     
anyways um so then I used pre strains from zero to 0.3 and this is for the     
9:39     
range in tissue it's normally used and forces between 0.1 nanometers     
9:47     
and 200 nanometers and this is AR range for small tissue samples um taken from     
9:55     
Atomic Force microscopy     
10:01     
there's the forces they were applied to the middle on the structure on top of     
10:06     
the T4 structure in the middle and there's the T4 and here are how the     
10:13     
forces are applied and for engineering stress I simply Ed the area of this     
10:20     
triangle and here's the the calculations for the triangle um that's on top of the     
10:28     
T4 structure for engineering     
10:33     
strain I use the original height of the cells so the Squamish model was 1.2     
10:39     
micrometers High the cuboidal model was 3.5 micrometers High and the colmer     
10:46     
model was 20.5 micrometers high and so engineering strength is a change in     
10:52     
height divided by the initial model height so this is an overall view of     
11:02     
what I did for my experiments I made a hexagon 3     
11:08     
model with the Squamish cuboidal and colmer wide posts and colmer thin posts     
11:16     
I tried some brief experiments of modifying the top and bottom of the     
11:21     
structure and I changed the forces applied to the structure I changed the pre string and I changed the spring     
11:32     
Foundation results um that was found     
11:37     
that the three cell uh tissue model mechanics were influenced by the     
11:43     
cytoskeleton values or the string I guess I should say string and bar at     
11:51     
string and bar values and the cellto cell connections     
11:57     
and the cell to basement um attachments and this occurs with other     
12:05     
models and with the measurement tissue they are ring on their attachments and     
12:11     
their um cytoskeleton values and these are sample     
12:20     
graphs and this one is in ttention and this one is in     
12:25     
compression and this is going with the convention where tension is uh going negative and     
12:34     
compression is positive that's just the reverse convention and this shows the     
12:41     
different pre-strains that I tested and you can see a good separation     
12:48     
of Curves in both um tension and contention and mostly this this     
12:55     
separation of Curves for both and compression occurred     
13:01     
in this Squamish model not the other     
13:06     
models and then there's a P value that is the area of the     
13:16     
string cross seal a of the string times its elasticity divided by the     
13:22     
cross-section area of the bar or Rod I guess it's a bar     
13:30     
29 bar and     
13:36     
um to give you a k value and this actually uh changes the the slope of the     
13:46     
uh elasticity curve and for my model I kept the Tres     
13:54     
post um with the same values as the bars     
14:02     
and the Tres poost the elasticity is both in tension and compression so the T     
14:09     
post is not not a tensity it's a     
14:15     
Twist so this is showing the what happens with the cell to cell connections so if I have a larger     
14:22     
distance between cells the membrane distance of 0.12 m     
14:30     
um you get this type of curve and it's     
14:35     
further apart and you get good separation of of the     
14:41     
curves but if you have um a separation     
14:46     
uh 0.05 micrometers then the curves are all     
14:51     
on top of one another and linear     
15:00     
and cell to basement membrane attachments if you change the spring     
15:07     
foundations sometimes you'll get a curve with good separation like this this one     
15:14     
with a the colmer wide um model but mostly this didn't     
15:24     
happen so I I remove the middle attachment spring attachment to the base     
15:32     
of a model and tried this with the Squamish     
15:37     
model and the curves basically collapsed and became very nonlinear here so this     
15:46     
is perhaps a disease State when you have the the middle completely     
15:53     
benched and it's um more I guess detaching a spring Foundation is     
16:01     
more important than um changing its     
16:07     
um uh spring con so     
16:14     
validation um someone um you at H made a um really     
16:23     
nice uh experiment where the Align cells on a     
16:29     
single sheet so they oriented the cells so the     
16:35     
or oriented cell sheets are here and this is a nonoriented     
16:41     
one and my um 10y model curves can     
16:47     
match uh these oriented cell sheets at least for for this one     
16:54     
um oriented cell sheets Das 15 so 15     
16:59     
micrometers by 15 micrometers and for this one I get a     
17:06     
very close match with the oriented cell sheets Das five when they're     
17:14     
um tensioned in uh perpendicular with their     
17:23     
alignment and that happens mostly with the pre- string 0.1 is is very close     
17:30     
match to the oriented cell sheet     
17:36     
-5 and then this is in compression this is the original uh graph and what I have here     
17:45     
are the average average of all of these     
17:51     
measurements and then this is my model and it's little I compared     
17:59     
to the lung tissue here but it it does Notch     
18:05     
within um I don't know about     
18:14     
30% um and the interesting thing about this is the curves are     
18:20     
reversed the 45% um uh     
18:26     
pre-rain is lower than the 0.1% pre strain and normally     
18:34     
that doesn't happen normally the pre a high pre-rain is the higher elasticity     
18:41     
curve and the lower pre-rain is below     
18:46     
it but my model does does model this reversal in some     
18:53     
instances and then I tried this with human skin just to see what with would     
18:59     
work and the Squamish model came in here     
19:05     
and the uh cuboidal model is here and the cuboidal model we saying     
19:13     
sort of matches the young skin but the swoish model kind of does too and this     
19:20     
is older skin on the bottom so there is somewhat of a match     
19:28     
and if I worked on this more um I can only get it to match better get a um     
19:36     
slightly different model     
19:45     
conclusions um so my hexagon three cell model can model tissue that's a helpful     
19:52     
and actually it's more linear um than the     
19:59     
the models of tissue quite often but um there are only three cells     
20:06     
in the model so perhaps um a model with more     
20:13     
more cells in it would work work would work differently um the main conclusion is     
20:20     
that the uh tissue tissues and the model alike are     
20:26     
reliant on their attachments and value vales of its structure as in the     
20:31     
elasticity of its strings and um bars kind to it keep     
20:40     
interchanging bars and rods anyway and the hexagon 3 cell model     
20:46     
can handle large stress and strain normally um models for that are used for     
20:53     
tissue are um up to uh point2 or 20% strain or     
21:01     
deformation and most tissue tissues yield at around 50% strain and then     
21:08     
therefore my model is good for modeling     
21:14     
tissue ask questions and     
21:24     
I that was very good thank you yeah okay any like     
21:30     
comments I'll bring your slides back up for a minute oh okay     
21:36     
sure uh you coordinated okay yeah looks like Dick's     
21:42     
here so I don't know if he wants to ask questions but I had a few questions so yeah go back up so I guess     
21:49     
one thing like when you go to the beginning of the talk and you go through     
21:55     
and you start introducing yeah like you talk about epithelia tissue then you go down to the     
22:01     
next one with yeah go to the next one that's a nice curve that's actually like you're     
22:08     
showing the different types of uh like tissues and then you're     
22:14     
showing like damaged tissue and then the drops off skin sample and what happens     
22:21     
to it when you tension it and when you tension it too much okay it breaks yeah     
22:27     
so this is this this is just a a skin sample and it starts out relaxed with a     
22:33     
low elasticity and then it tensions and the structures inside become more     
22:39     
aligned okay okay so this is I need to explain that better um yeah skin     
22:51     
sample     
22:57     
actually if if I get through it without tripping over my tongue I'll be just pleased to answer any     
23:03     
questions yeah so um     
23:09     
yeah so what what else would you like to see here uh they need kind of jump into     
23:15     
T segurity so like if you go down maybe another couple slides kind of yeah so     
23:23     
you get into the yeah you get into the 10 segr model you don't really talk about 10 segr much like you don't inter     
23:29     
motivate the tensegrity I don't know if they're used to hearing about it in in your group or not but no I I should be     
23:37     
explaining it but I have 30 minutes yeah and four     
23:43     
slides so yeah basically a TENS secrity is strings in tension and bars in     
23:51     
compression and they're held upright by being intentional they're a structure     
23:57     
that's in yeah okay so I mean probably different     
24:03     
from any other mechanics but anyways yeah so what else should I have     
24:09     
something well I mean I don't know yeah given your time constraints I mean I would put in like     
24:15     
maybe one one highly visual slide that shows like like you know how they have     
24:21     
10 secrity structures like mechanical tsy structures like geodesic domes or     
24:27     
things like that and showing like that it's something that is ultra stable so     
24:34     
they're examples of tens segr you have geodesic does you have Bucky Balls you     
24:40     
have things like that that are at least models if not outright things that you     
24:46     
can demonstrate the ultra stability well what I do have is I have my um K secrity     
24:55     
structure with me okay yeah you have the model yeah the physical I can actually hold it up and     
25:02     
say here it is this is a 10 Str and probably will okay this is it you know     
25:09     
I'll just do a I'll just do     
25:16     
a real life model visual yeah when I'm yeah that would be good yeah be good and     
25:25     
then this is very common uh tense AG structure this T3 they okay use this all     
25:31     
the time they and I just got a paper off the internet that says that they use     
25:38     
this 10 segy structure to model eoli and and looked at how it sticks the     
25:46     
surfaces okay anyway it's about the simplest 3D     
25:54     
Integrity structure out there yeah so what is what are E3 and E4     
26:00     
what do those stand for or T3 and T4 I'm sorry T T3 has     
26:09     
um three bars in it okay and that's how they named that     
26:17     
and then this is the T4 and I don't know why they called it the T4 because it's     
26:22     
just a a t two t3s on top of each other they're     
26:30     
so they have a more linear movement than the     
26:37     
t3s so they're they're good structured for the middle of my tensegrity because     
26:43     
they're kind of linear they don't uh twist too     
26:50     
much yeah when uh in tension and compression     
26:59     
anyways um this is showing the stress in     
27:04     
colors yeah so the blue is less stressed and the red is is very stressed so it's     
27:13     
mostly the strings in this model taking the stress and     
27:19     
strain okay yeah that's cool I mean like you     
27:26     
can see the simulation at least like how it it deforms and the change in the     
27:33     
values yeah I I wanted to do that for the hexagon model but um I would have     
27:41     
had to put together a movie and that might not have worked either I had to feed it individual forces in order to     
27:50     
get it to work and these structures probably because they're a     
27:55     
triangle worked fine with uh their automatic um changing of     
28:02     
forces between two two limits but     
28:09     
oh not the other one you go down here and you build this thing and this barely     
28:16     
stands up by itself and when you build this the only     
28:23     
way I could get this to work was the T4 in the middle     
28:28     
and the Tre t3s on the outside attached to the posts I just discovered that one day     
28:36     
where I wouldn't have a project yeah will not stand up if you     
28:42     
put the t3s or t4s I mean on the outside     
28:47     
it won't very fussy they're very these tties are very     
28:55     
fussy objects Maybe because cuz the world thinks in progression     
29:05     
yeah yeah and then then they Junctions so you had the tri Junction here and     
29:11     
then you had so the tri Junctions are kind of in the middle of the     
29:17     
structure and like it doesn't matter if you go in the like the tri Junctions are     
29:22     
just like the Junctions and in the same plane like when you have the attachment that doesn't count     
29:29     
I guess it this is the only attachment that's attaching these three together in     
29:35     
the middle okay and it's only for the top part of the T structure it just     
29:42     
attaches to the top that's oh I can see it this one it just attaches here to     
29:49     
that top ring to this top top ring yeah and     
29:56     
nowhere else like this these are are not attached the sides of the cells here are not     
30:01     
attached in real life there are other structures there but um in reading it     
30:08     
all uh they say that it doesn't come into play until the the cell is like 80%     
30:16     
compressed or 70% 70% right so a T4 the     
30:25     
structure why is the T4 here yeah why is it a T4 instead of a     
30:30     
T3 because the structure does not work and falls apart if I put a T3 in the     
30:37     
middle okay I don't know why so if they want me to do a PhD on     
30:45     
that I guess I could look into it but I really don't think I want     
30:52     
to yeah that's that's the way it goes every slide is a PhD so     
30:59     
yes yes this is like why does this work this way yeah yeah a question I don't     
31:08     
know I just discovered this one day oh wow yeah I kind of knew I needed a T4 in     
31:15     
the middle because it's a very stable it's one of the most stable tensity structures out     
31:21     
there and it doesn't twist and I could attach it to the top and bottom     
31:28     
of the top ring here     
31:36     
okay any other nice questions and well just keep going through the slides and     
31:41     
then dick has a couple questions but yeah I have oh no that's     
31:47     
not I it's 27 where I made the mistake     
31:53     
oh okay so skeleton values that the string string     
32:01     
and string and     
32:07     
bar values okay so it's the model not the     
32:14     
biology yeah trying to do     
32:21     
this because they don't know my audience or Engineers might not know what I mean     
32:26     
by a s site skeleton oh yeah and this is not a rod     
32:32     
this is a I can put a bar in     
32:37     
here yeah there we go I've been trying to call them bars and it seems to be     
32:45     
interchangeable sometimes in the literature     
32:51     
yeah okay so um it did you have any questions     
32:58     
he had two in the chat uh oh okay well     
33:03     
he said Beth Burnside showed a Beth Burnside show axio     
33:09     
microtubules so that's yes so they want to know what part of the cus     
33:14     
skeleton um I mean then um I'll just     
33:20     
tell them that     
33:25     
um um I did explain it in my thesis the micros have a a     
33:32     
larger H what do you call it continuation length um what do you call     
33:38     
that     
33:43     
um anyway they are long enough or occur at a long enough distance to be bars in     
33:49     
the cell and then I'm taking next famous um and I guess he said somebody else     
33:56     
showed this to him um a dowel a long dowel and a bunch of     
34:01     
elastics and if they want to know why I made my bars the same value elasticity     
34:10     
value as steel I can show them how that works because     
34:18     
microtubules are actually uh around about a gigap pascal     
34:24     
or two gigap pascals um     
34:29     
elasticity so that's not 200 so how does it get to be 200 well you take your doll     
34:35     
and you put elastics up and down it and if you tension the elastics it becomes     
34:41     
stiffer and you can just demonstrate that to the audience so I'm going to use it like     
34:48     
they're going to ask this question and I'm going to get doctor's Ang to hold     
34:55     
the uh D up because it's tension and there's act     
35:02     
actomyosin throughout the cell it's just not in most of it's     
35:08     
concentrated in the belt at the top but it's also distributed throughout the     
35:14     
cell and is attached to microtubules I just saw a paper on it I     
35:21     
didn't quote it if they want me to quote all of my sources and the things that     
35:26     
I'm saying off the top of my had I could have like 500 references in this     
35:36     
paper oh how much computer time for nine cells well seven cells would would give     
35:41     
you a nice a nicer model in my opinion     
35:50     
um this computer and this is a six-year-old computer will do this in like two     
35:58     
seconds the three cell model so it'll only take like     
36:05     
seconds probably anyway broadland and     
36:11     
Gordon oh yes yes and I quoted someone who says that at the     
36:19     
70% uh strain which most um tissues apparently don't get to because they     
36:26     
break before that um at least the dead tissue well even     
36:34     
the live tissue there it was only getting up to 60% but anyway if it gets to 70% the     
36:41     
vinicin um strings are attached     
36:47     
and they help they prevent buckling     
36:54     
yeah they H they um okay and the micr micr S intermediate     
37:02     
filaments yeah intermediate filaments are attached to the nucleus     
37:08     
and attached to the desmosomes on the side of the the cells and there's also I     
37:15     
just got a paper and says there's punctum along the side of the cells as     
37:20     
well so um I haven't included intermediate     
37:28     
filaments and I um have said that the attachments are     
37:35     
at the top with the tri Junctions the t4es and the     
37:41     
t3s and that was my very simple model this is the simplest model I could make     
37:47     
tissue three cells and four attachments at the the     
37:54     
top belt anyway um you can't     
38:02     
unmute to hear more     
38:08     
questions I mean you had more questions put them in the chat but okay and please     
38:13     
don't post this until my thesis is handed in     
38:19     
somehow um because     
38:24     
okay um you can the discovering that it needed a T3 in the middle like that is     
38:33     
my is my thesis or makes my thesis because then I was able to get a model to work and then I was able to test     
38:41     
it and see that there was good separation of curves or see what conditions caused     
38:48     
good separation of those curves and where it was nonlinear and where it's nonlinear I think it could produce a J     
38:55     
curve under the right uh condition it's just uh wobbles     
39:01     
around yeah I don't know how to how to say     
39:07     
that and anyway it's got a nonlinear portion and then it linear as it gets     
39:14     
stretched so right yeah and I'm near Winnipeg in     
39:20     
Niverville right now and it looks like it's sleeing or something oh okay yeah so I'm close to Peg so I'll     
39:28     
hopefully be able to     
39:34     
drive when is your defense or at three o'clock this afternoon oh okay good     
39:42     
luck yeah anyway yeah five years work please     
39:49     
explain it in 30 minutes I still have my slides here if you have another question     
39:56     
okay well yeah let's go through the rest of your slides it would be I'm I'm aware of microt tribes being     
40:03     
long and being the bars in the situation I don't know if the engineers care so     
40:10     
you want to see the slides again yeah yeah let's do that okay um share screen     
40:18     
where's the share screen that no I'm sharing     
40:25     
screen to pull up your yeah so can you see that yeah yeah you     
40:31     
can see my cytoskeleton values yes yeah cytoskeleton     
40:37     
and um again I need to do this     
40:43     
string and R and     
40:50     
in PH skeleton I'll just put that in     
40:58     
brackets so I can introduce that to them if they need it introduced yeah that's     
41:08     
good well that's yeah that's nice yeah and this was this was a nice     
41:15     
find as well because you can adjust this K value     
41:22     
and it it changes the curve on my model     
41:29     
mind you I've got it down so that it only withstands about two Nano Newtons     
41:34     
of force because it's so small but if you're using Atomic Force     
41:41     
microscopy that's what you get like it's small like it was being measured with     
41:48     
atomic Force microscopy if you make the the strings this uh 0.5 megap pascals as     
41:56     
though it was elastin that's the value of elastin in a     
42:01     
Cell so um I guess it was Stephen levans said     
42:07     
don't make a squish he says that you shouldn't make     
42:13     
your strings elastic well I think some cells are squishes so that was that's my one of my     
42:21     
conclusions from all this is that some cells are squishies so I don't know whether I should tell my committee     
42:31     
that so so there's a very broad range of     
42:38     
elasticity here and that's because tissue has a broad R range of elasticity     
42:46     
so I I made I made it like a broad range of course yeah um     
42:52     
to try this out and more or less I'm trying this out within uh what I consider to be uh a     
43:01     
living cell's range so my most of my models that I match to the tissue are K     
43:09     
= 5 * 10us     
43:15     
nine oh yeah okay yeah which don't really match the forces in anything     
43:20     
except that single cell sheet but this this single cell sheet here is um close     
43:27     
closer to my model because it's three cells and these are like how many 50     
43:33     
yeah I don't so so any other questions can you say     
43:42     
them out loud since I can't see the see or the text can do you have questions     
43:48     
that you can that Bradley can reinterpret     
43:54     
or anyway I was very pleased this one worked so well like I said it's     
44:01     
5 * 10- 9 sish     
44:07     
Cell matches this and these orig these cells these oriented cell sheets were     
44:14     
made out of cardio mys so I don't know so when you say a perpendicular     
44:21     
Force you mean like something that kind of comes from the top of     
44:28     
side to side because the these are oriented cell sheets so     
44:35     
they've oriented them in groups so they they're aligned um you see you'll see it in the     
44:42     
picture actually so these OC fs- FS are are aligned along these     
44:50     
groups okay so this graph here is tensioning them in the the aligned     
44:58     
Direction and The these ones here are     
45:04     
perpendicular to the aligned Direction so they're the other way     
45:10     
okay so it's like the it's the perpendicular to the     
45:16     
alignment yeah so it's a perpendicular stretch so it's stretching the     
45:23     
perpendicular stretch is stretching this way and this is an align stretch so it's     
45:29     
stretching it this way I have a a picture of their homemade device where they uh glued it glued these cells and     
45:38     
then stretched them and they've made a similar type of Click arrangement for     
45:45     
measuring cardiio so they were they were talking to each other they got cardyes     
45:52     
from the lab that was doing this and they made a single cell sheet and Orient cell     
46:01     
sheets interest yeah dick has a question if the cell contracts will an adjacent     
46:07     
cell also contract in the cardio y seats they show     
46:14     
it that when they pull on it they pull on it and it contracts and pull on and     
46:21     
it contracts um I haven't really looked at that but there is     
46:27     
if you go into this paper they're thanking the lab for the cardio mys I think you could probably go back from     
46:35     
from that but all they've been studying     
46:43     
um cardiac tissue so if you want to answer that     
46:49     
question I guess look at some of the cardiac stuff they've also been looking at lung     
46:56     
but lung complicated like this this is a Cav I     
47:02     
think it's um pork pink uh     
47:08     
lung but it's a complicated tissue there's uh Squamish cells mixed     
47:15     
in with some ligament stuff     
47:21     
yeah so yeah that's the other question is like if you have a diversity of     
47:26     
different different sort of arrangements and you apply a force and     
47:31     
they're kind of in there together you know what does that look like I know that's kind of a lot harder to     
47:38     
model yeah so yes so this isn't um an exact model of this particular tissue     
47:46     
yeah like I said the um cell sheets are are much     
47:51     
better but they didn't do the cell sheets in compression they just did them in tension and so this was actually a a     
48:00     
thesis you can see this Devon     
48:05     
wasak um did this and he said he did it because there was a lack of data in the     
48:13     
literature but yeah there's a lack of data especially for     
48:19     
compression so we compress lung tissue yeah and then basically um     
48:27     
there was a lack of data there weren't very many um graphs     
48:33     
for me to compare this with a lot of them do uh time     
48:39     
studies where you're um giving pulses of force     
48:47     
to to their uh tissue mind you Atomic Force microscopy     
48:57     
um is in compression but it's um they're measuring one cell like for in my um     
49:06     
thesis I have one example where where they're measuring the force between two     
49:16     
cells and they might be pulling on that actually I don't it's anyway it's in my     
49:24     
PES and this like they're pulling on these and my model is actually a     
49:31     
compression is and tension both compression and tension so this is a so     
49:37     
I use the tension um these are from my model and     
49:44     
their tension curves same with this one that's a tension curve and then I was using     
49:51     
compression curves here using compression curves     
49:57     
and like I said there's this inverse where you've got the pre- string large     
50:04     
pre- string is um is the bottom curve normally it would be the top and I could     
50:10     
get my model to do that um only in a few instances so this is a very     
50:16     
particular L yeah it's 8 * eus 9 the k k value     
50:29     
spring Foundation of 1,000 Newtons per     
50:35     
meter in compression and I I compressed it the     
50:40     
same with the same pre- strings they did so I did 0.1 2 35 and     
50:51     
point4 and I got a a result but if you change     
50:57     
um the amount like if you made that 10,000 new Newtons per meter you get a     
51:02     
different curve here yeah where you get     
51:08     
the correct order where you have the 45 or     
51:13     
45% pre string here it goes on top it's on     
51:24     
topil yeah questions I think that's it if you just go to your     
51:30     
conclusions I guess yeah yeah I didn't like I did show one of the small     
51:37     
experiments I did where I took the elastics elastic um     
51:45     
Foundation off of the middle of the model and then it it didn't work very     
51:50     
well um I didn't include that in the conclusions but when I started this     
51:56     
that's one of the things that I wanted to see is if you change the foundation     
52:02     
of the tissue it changes its     
52:07     
reaction yeah and that's proven in like all of     
52:13     
the literature that I've looked at if you have a different     
52:20     
um what different substrate yeah if you have a different substrate     
52:27     
then you'll get a differences in development like if you have a the     
52:33     
tissue on glass that'll be uh developed into a fo and if you have the tissue     
52:41     
tissue on a loose elastic substrate of some     
52:46     
sort uh collagen perhaps um then it'll develop into atopus tissue or something     
52:54     
like I have I have graphs through that and the one thing that I'm hiding that I     
53:00     
didn't want anybody to ask the question about was how do the springs on the     
53:06     
bottom of the model relate to the the substrate um     
53:14     
elasticity and I can't answer that because the elasticity is in Newton's     
53:20     
per meter squared and my Springs are in Newton per meter     
53:26     
I don't go over what area these Springs are acting they're Point SS in a model     
53:35     
right so I don't so yes what would you like to know about my     
53:41     
conclusions yeah yeah that'd be good     
53:46     
well okay so I've proven that they could my model pin model     
53:52     
tissue and that that tissues are reliant on their uh attachments and also the     
54:01     
values of their structure and then um my model my three     
54:09     
cell model can handle very large stress and strain and the other models out there     
54:16     
like the Ogden model can only handle up to about 20% strain or deformation     
54:23     
before it fails and most tissues yield between well 50% and     
54:32     
60% okay so this is a better model model in that way for for handling     
54:40     
tissue so tissues are much can yield can like survive under much more strain than     
54:46     
say like your typical yeah much more strain than say iron or steel although     
54:52     
there are some Steels that apparently go up to 500% but if you don't count the special     
55:00     
steel you can like a lot of     
55:05     
of materials quit at about that 20% stream or     
55:12     
before but tissue is lasts better it's     
55:19     
uh good for 50% strain usually although the one that 1% um     
55:27     
go back here if you get um 10% pre-rain on     
55:36     
lung tissue it fails at about 10% to .1     
55:43     
string and this this is all engineering stress and strin here this this is um an     
55:50     
engineering department and they were sure to tell me that this was engineering stress and engineering     
55:55     
stength but I don't want to emphasize that either because I read this paper and I     
56:01     
think that's what they were doing but they didn't     
56:08     
say yeah this one says that it's engineering stress and strength this one     
56:14     
from reading it yes that's what they were doing but it's like I think some     
56:19     
biologist wrote it not some Engineers I need to know whether this is engineering stress or stength please just say it     
56:27     
so the difference is like what what is the difference between engineering and non-engineering stress and stams well     
56:34     
when a tissue like for instance my model yeah back up to my model to explain this     
56:42     
um when my model is compressed this middle part here that I'm measuring the     
56:48     
middle this little triangle sprays out like it flattens when pring it and so so if you     
56:56     
were just doing two true stress you would take the um enlarging area and use     
57:06     
that to divide your Force by to get your your stress but is I'm just using the     
57:15     
original size for engineering stress okay and not     
57:23     
the not how it it enlarg as it goes so there's true stress right     
57:31     
so that make more sense for Cells versus     
57:37     
like yeah so part of that maybe the curve thing that isn't going on with my     
57:45     
model is simply that I'm using engineering stress that's but that seems to be how most of the well my choice     
57:57     
of tissue examples is like it's they've     
58:03     
done engineering stress and strain with it so so I'm comparing the same     
58:10     
thing okay all right that looks good well thanks for presenting that and     
58:17     
good luck with this uh presentation today and well thank you for letting me     
58:24     
talk about it and just feel too nervous well no I think     
58:30     
it's great I think it's fascinating you know like figuring out kind of how to     
58:35     
model tissues in this way and um yeah I mean I see     
58:42     
yeah yeah the professor of um well     
58:48     
biosystems engineering who who knows his mechanics is quite impressed with the model because it you can you can     
58:55     
completely flatten the model and it's still giving you some values mind you I didn't put any yield values in it uh you     
59:04     
could to make it a more complete model but yeah he can stretch really     
59:11     
stretch the the model out yeah all right yeah so I don't know if     
59:20     
dick has any more questions but he asked me to check my email so I'll check my email and get back to him on     
59:27     
um but yeah so yeah if that's all we have um I     
59:34     
guess we can go it's at the top of the hour so but yeah good luck Susan with the     
59:41     
talk yeah I don't know whether I'll go to The Talk The oh okay there's a name and to paper     
59:48     
oh yeah it looks good I don't know it's probably yeah next meeting     
59:56     
I I don't know if I'll go to the slam meeting this morning there's a nice slam meeting or maybe I will I don't know     
1:00:04     
just like this is too nervous yeah yeah     
1:00:09     
okay did I stop sharing no yeah there go     
1:00:14     
better yeah looks yeah this this paper dick pulled up yeah it looks pretty     
1:00:20     
good um it's about asymmetric cell division     
1:00:26     
and celegans they do some work in celegans they propose that nonlinear     
1:00:32     
nonlinear signal response Dynamics between symmetry breaking P polarity     
1:00:39     
which is uh this mechanism in uh asymmetric cell     
1:00:46     
division and asymmetric cell division modules effectively insulate each     
1:00:51     
individual module from variation or rising in others convincing your hand waving well yeah going into the paper I     
1:00:58     
don't know but it looks like the par so par polarity is this par     
1:01:04     
protein and they arguing I guess that the dosage of the par protein is initiating this ASM see     
1:01:12     
asymmetrical cell division from s symmetrical cell divisions yeah so I'll     
1:01:17     
do this next week um and present on it and uh yeah we'll see what what it looks     
1:01:23     
like what they're getting at here     
1:01:28     
anyways thank you again like you're it's nice to present this to a somewhat     
1:01:34     
knowledgeable audience because then all I'm getting from my son for     
1:01:41     
instance is uh what was that again he was kind of interested because     
1:01:48     
he's interested in mechanical engineering but it's just he's a     
1:01:53     
mechanic that's what he does right so asore yeah a job he lost he lost his job     
1:02:03     
he lost a really good job not getting along with the supervisor Bo no job had     
1:02:09     
a job in three     
1:02:17     
days three days yeah unbelievable     
1:02:27     
all right so yeah the other mechanic in my life is my daughter's husband and he     
1:02:35     
went and got a job for $200,000 a year wow yeah because it's e     
1:02:44     
yeah I took the wrong perion     
1:02:49     
obviously need these days     
1:02:56     
anyways okay all right thanks for ATT thanks for presenting     
1:03:01     
Susan okay all right talk to you later bye s
