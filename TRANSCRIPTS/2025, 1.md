     
0:00     
hello hello how are you just you and me huh     
0:08     
yeah okay I'm doing fine good I'm using mathematic Now with uh uh     
0:18     
what they call notebook assistant what's that which is an     
0:23     
AI well I rated chat GTP as being like a toddler right uh The Notebook assistant     
0:31     
is like a nine-year-old not not terribly smart but     
0:37     
getting there     
0:42     
uh and it tells me things which the staff says are not true okay     
0:51     
yeah okay so anyway at least it's faster than trying     
0:57     
to find an expert on Mathematica and ask some questions and send them your code     
1:02     
oh that's true yeah should be able to me help for there I guess doesn't complain it it doesn't     
1:10     
check time that's     
1:15     
great okay I guess you can go ahead got two people yeah we got some people     
1:24     
sub uh soam and sham so hello how how are you     
1:33     
guys hi I'm good how are you all right great fine sir how are you sir all right     
1:41     
how are you could you introduce     
1:46     
yourselves so uh uh I am shubam from India and I'm     
1:55     
currently doing my undergraduate from chandigar University uh     
2:00     
and I a computer science student and looking forward to work with you     
2:06     
sir yeah welcome yeah that's good     
2:13     
so um oh did you mean soam or     
2:19     
sh that um did you mean soam or sham we     
2:25     
have very similar names uh yeah just introduce yourself I guess you know oh yeah uh I'm sorry I'm     
2:33     
unable to access my webcam uh so I am personing my undergraduate at I Madras I     
2:40     
came across the research work on C Elegance so that picked my interest so I     
2:47     
was just hoping if I could contribute something in that direction okay yeah that's great well     
2:53     
thank you for attending um and introducing yourselves you know we do these meetings once a week uh and you     
3:00     
know we cover a number of topics so you know you don't understand something that's okay you know you're supposed to     
3:07     
just soak in what you can't understand and if you something really want to cover or you want to present something     
3:13     
you're welcome to do that or if there's something you're really interested in you know please uh ask questions or     
3:20     
whatever so that's good I assume you both have been through the openworm     
3:25     
slack so that's where um yeah we do some post ing their like different     
3:32     
discussions and things um and then the Google summer of code uh activity will     
3:38     
start up kind of in the early spring where we'll have some uh projects I     
3:43     
think we'll probably continue on with the projects that we've been we worked     
3:48     
on last year so that description will be available soon um and you know we'll if you have     
3:56     
questions about that you know that's something you can ask as well because we do have we don't really have a     
4:02     
maintainer for that repository we just have the repository there um it's the in     
4:08     
the dvo learn uh GitHub and it's dvo uh D graph so that's     
4:16     
where that repository is and you know again we don't have it's not active all     
4:22     
year round usually usually do a lot of development in the Summers and then rest of the year we have sporadic Eng     
4:29     
engagement with it but we'll be following up on those projects and I'll kind of explain what those are     
4:36     
later um looks like Susan's here     
4:44     
hello so what were things for you this year did you get your thesis submitted     
4:50     
yeah on Friday I uploaded my thesis to     
4:55     
mpace that means I added it in yeah yeah just so yeah different than having to     
5:04     
make two copies of it one in color and one in black and white and drag it over to the the     
5:11     
office yeah the last time and in by what was it four o'clock     
5:18     
and I got there at 5 to 4 oh wow and then I I there were a couple people     
5:24     
behind me and I said oh I'm not the last one     
5:31     
anyways this time um I hope it was okay I handed it in at 6:30 in the evening     
5:38     
good yeah and if it isn't they can give me an extension because it's there I don't want anything more to do with     
5:44     
it kind of annoyed at it I didn't get all my permissions so I had to change     
5:50     
four graphs and two diagrams yes that I had to make myself     
5:57     
all on Friday oh so like ah I'll probably get the     
6:03     
permissions late this week I don't     
6:08     
know yeah better everything is okay all yeah I     
6:17     
think so yeah reasonably and if they said well we're sorry you're late handing it in you can't graduate till     
6:24     
June I'll go so what what's your point I don't care     
6:31     
anyway yeah I'm kind of done with it but um     
6:38     
look looking for to new ones yeah that's good yeah     
6:45     
congratulations okay um some salamander stuff and then Dick had the another 10     
6:52     
segr idea so oh yeah lots of things to do yeah yeah maybe fewer     
7:00     
deadlines right yeah like I'm just enjoyed this weekend because there were     
7:05     
no assignments do or no deadlines that I had to meet or anything like that I like     
7:13     
it's like summer vacation yeah so you said there was     
7:21     
further like ideation about the uh uh 10 segr so where do you see that going that     
7:29     
work well for one thing I was invited to write a paper with Dr Zang on a 10 segy     
7:38     
thesis maybe just a 10 page thing saying what I did and then um I enrolled in APS     
7:47     
uh March meeting to present it for 10     
7:53     
minutes um I still have to run that by the two     
7:58     
professors like iy can drop out if I if they yell     
8:04     
anyway um and then what was that the     
8:09     
um oh the nucleus yes the balancing of nuclear for forces are probably a t     
8:17     
secrity di say so oh right I heard about     
8:23     
this yes I don't think it has anything to do with evil worm exactly but no     
8:30     
has atams yeah everything has atams but yeah not directly dealing with right and uh     
8:39     
what was the oh yes I'm hope like Dr share has said yes I can use these     
8:46     
equipment when it's not being used and I can get some images of salamander     
8:54     
eggs of their blast to seal because you can't see um     
8:59     
individual cells but you can certainly see the blast toil developing and that's all I need like I just wanted     
9:08     
to tell the biologists out there that this technology is available and my main     
9:16     
motive is to have the biologist lining up at Dr sharif's     
9:21     
store several layers deep like I I would you know Revenge of the Nerds um     
9:31     
it's silly that it isn't being used because it's the you can IM me just     
9:38     
howand egg and have it grow up and carry     
9:45     
on so that's good yeah yeah you well I showed you     
9:53     
the my PowerPoint about it but I think I'll make a short PowerPoint for Dr     
9:58     
Sharie it's not as detailed to sort of so     
10:06     
introduce him to the concept and say any other method that has been tried to     
10:12     
image Blast toils has uh basically destroys the     
10:17     
egg yeah yeah any anything else like MRI     
10:24     
X-rays of course cutting it up like it all destroys the eggs so     
10:34     
yeah anyway so that's kind of what I'm doing I guess it sounds good     
10:41     
yeah yeah good luck with the work on H 10 seties sure there are other ideas     
10:47     
like I don't know is do you see yourself like continuing on with the like in     
10:54     
general like continuing on with the biotens segurity work yeah well I I was     
11:00     
I wanted to make um is a seven cell T secrity that kind of fits there's one in     
11:06     
the middle and then surrounding it I would like to try to make that and I couldn't get my hexagons to     
11:15     
line up so Dr Zang says no just do the simple one I mean it is a subset of it     
11:23     
and and so I've done that and I've there are more things I could do with     
11:29     
with the simple one but I prefer to do it with the seven cell one because it's more more tissue     
11:37     
like obviously um so so I I'll I'll make     
11:44     
one um and then I would like to to find a more open source um finite element     
11:52     
program to use or one that could be manipulated or something but I really     
11:58     
don't want want to have to program in Linux to do it so I'm not     
12:04     
sure I don't know why don't I why am I resistant to programming and     
12:11     
Linux a lot of times people use like software for their thesis like say like     
12:16     
consa and then they have a like they don't want to ever experience that again so they well I know how to manipulate it     
12:23     
sort of but if if I was to do a proper job of it I would be rewriting the     
12:30     
software for his console yeah yeah because hire     
12:38     
you oh I don't want to be hired by them     
12:44     
no I had one student who went to work for them oh     
12:50     
okay well it's a finite element program     
12:56     
finite element analysis I'm from what I can see it is     
13:01     
not compatible with tensegrities because you can build there's a famous     
13:06     
tensegrity that's an X and then it has strings on the top and then there's     
13:12     
another X on top of that and if you build that in console it just falls down     
13:19     
like they it just like does not compute does not work um that's because it's too too     
13:27     
bouncy like if it changes shape a lot then it figures the bridge fell     
13:33     
down okay yeah and it's not a bridge it's a Tegrity and it will change shape     
13:40     
that's what they do anyway     
13:47     
it's the reason why I got away with it was because I built the most stable tensegrity I could     
13:54     
find it lined up with the structure of cell     
14:01     
it was very simple and the most stable one I could find it's called a     
14:08     
T4 you know I don't know if you know what a T4 is but yeah you talk about it     
14:13     
before yeah I was talking about but you the the simplest 3D 10 segurity is three     
14:21     
three uh three lines together like this with strings top and bottom and sides     
14:30     
and you put two of them together and that's a T4 and for some reason that is a very     
14:36     
stable Integrity anyway so that's what I used     
14:42     
basically for the whole thing     
14:48     
yeah anyway well thanks yeah for the update     
14:55     
on that like Morgan I     
15:02     
to well Morgan H so yeah today morning oh good     
15:07     
morning yeah today we're gonna talk about     
15:13     
um a couple papers um the first one this is something that     
15:20     
dick found um in the literature uh towards the end of last     
15:25     
year and this is uh on it's quantitative perturbation phenotype     
15:31     
Maps reveal nonlinear responses underlying robustness the par dependent     
15:37     
asymmetric cell division so this is a cell division sort of like building maps     
15:43     
and kind of looking at these par dependent cell division events this is     
15:49     
in celegans we'll get into that in a minute uh there's this other paper here     
15:56     
I don't know if we'll get into it today but this is also an interesting one this is from E life the geometric basis of     
16:03     
epithelial convergent extension so this is not like uh     
16:09     
tensegrity but this is actually talking about some ways to     
16:14     
analyze uh some of the geometries that result from some of these epithelial cell movements this is a cell movement     
16:21     
convergent extension during development and they're actually using uh what are     
16:27     
it let's see I can actually look at life assessment to give the significance here     
16:33     
this important study analyzes in the original way how tension pattern Dynamics can reveal the contribution of     
16:41     
active versus passive interpolation courses during tissue     
16:47     
elongation the authors develop a compl compelling elegant analytical framework     
16:54     
as is called isogonal tension decomposition disentangle the passive     
17:00     
adjacent tissues pulling active local tension and isotropy     
17:06     
contributions interpolation events this allows the generation of global maps of     
17:12     
tissue mechanics uh that can help understand this process so that basically they're     
17:19     
looking at this uh they have this analytical framework isogonal tension     
17:25     
decomposition and there are two components the passive component the active component the passive component     
17:31     
are where you have adjacent tissues pulling on this uh structure and then     
17:37     
the active or these local tension ioses so this is uh kind of going     
17:45     
through U what they're doing here like I said I don't think they're using any uh     
17:51     
tensegrity stuff directly but they're kind of developing this uh technique     
17:57     
they're looking at this and this is done I think in     
18:02     
dropa so they're using dropa embryo to get at some of these uh issues here uh     
18:10     
where they actually have look at gastrulation and then convergent     
18:16     
extension of the lateral ectoderm and the flow of tissue from the ventral onto the dorsal side of the     
18:22     
embryo uh kind of going through this process uh they talk about a tissue     
18:30     
tectonics analysis which is kind of where they're looking at changes in the     
18:36     
tissue uh and then they say well the above tissue tectonics analysis reveals     
18:42     
the cell skill kinetics during GBE which is uh up here which is this uh germ band     
18:51     
extension process uh it does not address the fundamental question of the underlying     
18:57     
driving forces and so this is where you know interpolations are associated with     
19:02     
localized activity of the force generating protein non muscle myosin to     
19:09     
or they want to build a model of these interlog driving forces so they do this light sheet Imaging and     
19:15     
segmentation in a there's this process where they're kind ofing out the cells or modeling the cells through this     
19:22     
segmentation of cells and then putting it into this model uh and then B is where the model     
19:29     
this cell-shaped deformation they're modeling you know a group of four cells and they're modeling deformation then     
19:36     
they're modeling this interpolation process here in B and in C they're     
19:42     
looking at uh these different regions and kind of how these uh you know how     
19:50     
these cells deform sort of in these over time in these local     
19:55     
Windows um D is uh let's see convergence and     
20:01     
extension of the lateral ectoderm so this is the fold change over time so this is where you have 50 minutes of     
20:09     
time you have this fold change it's kind of from zero to a half fold to onefold     
20:17     
to twofold and then you have the length which is in red and the width which is in blue the width being dorsal ventral     
20:25     
and the length being anterior posterior and you get these different phases here     
20:31     
where you have uh so the GB is germ band extension which is after 20     
20:37     
minutes uh vfi is vental furrow imagination which is from 10 to 20 minutes so you see it captures these     
20:44     
processes uh uh for vfi you basically have the     
20:50     
length has a slightly higher fold change uh relative to the width and then for     
20:57     
GBE it diverges so that the forces on the width are changing much slower than     
21:05     
the forces on the uh on the length this is during germ band extension so they     
21:12     
have these two components of that change the Fast and the slow so for the length     
21:17     
from anterior to posterior you have this germband extension process where the     
21:23     
fold change is increasing faster initially and then slower     
21:29     
we're able to actually take that and actually characterize it in terms of     
21:34     
this graph here in D so again D is this uh convergence and     
21:40     
extension of the lateral ectoderm XF change Ro defined relative to the minimum length and maximum width so they     
21:48     
they have that e being the interface collapse rate so the interface collapse     
21:54     
rate is shown here uh the let's see if     
22:00     
so they talk about the rate of interface collapses serves as a measure for the cell interpolation rate during vfi there     
22:07     
are a few interpolations during GBE a majority of interpolations our T1 transitions while     
22:15     
rosettes rearrangements involving more than four cells contributed significantly less to tissue     
22:21     
deformation so at 40 minutes there's a noticeable drop in the T1 rate making     
22:27     
the transition to the slow pH of GBE and so that's what they're doing here they're just looking at the     
22:32     
interface collapse uh and they don't really say what the yellow and blue lines are but     
22:41     
they show this so they show these rosettes which are these motifs that     
22:46     
they show in B in C and then here where they have a fourfold and a fivefold rosette so it's like these uh Junctions     
22:53     
that we've been talking about with you see like a a five Junction here for this     
23:00     
rosette and then you see this is the uh e Prime is the counts and so okay the the yellow is t1s     
23:09     
and the blue are the rosettes and so the rosettes are down here the T1 is here and then the T1     
23:16     
being in yellow and then the rosettes in the blue so you can see that the interface collapse is greater for the     
23:22     
t1s they're more t1s so that's the some of the modeling     
23:28     
done here uh they also show some things with     
23:36     
having to do with the interface so they have this uh group of four cells here they     
23:43     
have this model of the cells and the acting here and then these relative     
23:49     
tensions relative to the angle of contact here um and they show this in I guess     
23:57     
this is in culture and then how the model Works um then they have some they     
24:03     
characterize us as graphs relative tension interface length time to collapse versus relative     
24:11     
tension and then some of these act you know some of these processes in terms of     
24:17     
how the angle of contact deforms so you have active contraction passive     
24:23     
extension passive contraction and passive extension and those are just changes in how these cells sort of their     
24:33     
angle of contact and how they're um you know how the actin and myosin on on the     
24:39     
boundaries are changing and deforming so I mean there's I don't know     
24:46     
how much more they have they've done a lot of work in this paper um but I think I'll leave that     
24:54     
to in the interest of getting the next paper I think I'll leave that to if you're interested in Reading More diving     
25:01     
into the paper little B more um so any questions and then we'll move     
25:08     
on to the other paper     
25:18     
in I think I might have the paper already okay yeah you may have sent it     
25:23     
to me too I remember     
25:29     
okay but that's interesting it's that's inoph so it's you know not seans but it's also not nals but we do have these     
25:37     
like processes that you know you can model with converion extension things that are common to different types of     
25:44     
tissue formation so it's interesting work I mean especially in light of the     
25:49     
tensegrities uh they don't talk about tensegrities directly in the paper but I     
25:54     
guess it's relevant to describing some of the stability some of their measures are you know I don't know     
26:03     
how how good or I mean I guess they're simple measures but there probably other ways you can measure some of these     
26:09     
processes     
26:17     
with uh Wayne broadland Uh took a paper that     
26:24     
I did a long time ago and uh made it into a uh a a method of looking at     
26:32     
epithelia to get the forces between cells okay I don't know if they     
26:39     
mentioned that or not but uh uh the uh the question I've got is     
26:46     
whether or not it can bring out the passive and active     
26:53     
forces yeah I'll see if I can find it all     
27:02     
right yeah I don't think they talk about that directly I don't know how they're getting do they mention BR in the     
27:19     
paper I think they're doing a lot of things by extracting out of like images in the time series of the images that's     
27:27     
how they're getting a lot of these measures here the     
27:37     
appendix uh you don't see that citation     
27:44     
any yeah but yeah I don't know     
27:50     
I yeah I don't see it     
27:58     
all right so let's move on to the next paper um yeah I think I found it I'll     
28:04     
put in the chat here okay yeah there we go yeah this is     
28:12     
2010 Rodland uh authors this is video Force     
28:18     
microscopy reveals the mechanics of ventral fural imagination for software so this is that     
28:26     
system uh and and yeah this is the citation     
28:35     
here all right thank you for that D um sure yeah so this is uh a diff kind of     
28:43     
Shifting Gears a little bit um this is where they're talking about quantitative     
28:49     
perturbation phenotype which is we'll talk about what that is feel nonlinear responses     
28:56     
underlying robustness a par dependent asymmetric cell division so par dependent is um a type     
29:06     
of you know it's just we we'll talk about par is and then the asymmetric cell divisions     
29:12     
related so okay so let's start with the abstract here um so this is actually uh     
29:21     
published in close biology uh a key challenge in the development of an organism is to Main     
29:28     
main robust phenotypic outcomes in the face of perturbation yet it is often unclear how     
29:34     
such robust outcomes are encoded by developmental networks so they're talking about um gene expression     
29:42     
networks or Gene regulatory networks uh largely so you know how do you     
29:49     
basically correct how does the organism correct itself when it's exposed to     
29:55     
auration so it's like you know if you EXP oppos it to low temperature variation in temperature or a variation     
30:03     
in forces you know what is the eff of and you know we know from like developmental     
30:12     
systems that often times the you know there is this sort of robustness that     
30:18     
happens that if you expose you know sometimes their characteristic responses to     
30:24     
perturbations sometimes there's this sort of robustness that happens and so development just doesn't become     
30:31     
incoherent usually you have some sort of characteristic response they call them     
30:37     
reaction Norms or something similar so that's how what they're kind of getting     
30:43     
at what's going on sort of at the developmental network uh     
30:48     
level here we use the cigan zygote as a model to understand sources of     
30:54     
Developmental robustness during par polarity dependent asymmetric cell     
30:59     
division so par is a protein that gets expressed you have this protein dosage     
31:06     
that we're going to be interested in and it's going to be you know this is going to drive asymmetric cell division which     
31:14     
is in cases where you know you have differences in size in the cells or you     
31:20     
only have one cell that results from the cell division so that's what they mean     
31:25     
by asymmetric cell divisions different differences in the uh in the lineage tree where you have changes in the size     
31:33     
of the daughter cells or you only have one daughter cell and it's not symmetrical usually you expect to have a     
31:40     
mother cell give rise to two daughter cells and then those daughter cells would rise the daughter     
31:48     
cells so by linking uh qualitatively or by quantitatively linking alterations     
31:53     
and protein dosage to phenotype and individual embryos we show that spatial information in the     
32:00     
zygote is brought out in a highly nonlinear fashion and as a result     
32:06     
phenotypes are highly canalized against substantial variation in input signals     
32:11     
so this is where again we we draw from waddington's idea of canalization where you have this sort of     
32:20     
robustness you have this uh phenotypic buffering they call it and you you know     
32:27     
depending on the input perturbation you end up with us a very similar type of     
32:34     
phenotypic output so in other words if I perturb my embryo in different ways and     
32:40     
all sort there are all sorts of perturbations and development sometimes there's developmental noise sometimes     
32:45     
there variations in the environment sometimes there are other things going on this this ensures that the process is     
32:54     
sort of regularized that it's it doesn't vary too much much from embryo to embryo     
33:00     
and so this is this canalization process so phenotypes are highly canalized     
33:05     
against substantial variation in input signs uh that means if you have all     
33:10     
these perturbations acting on the embryo that it doesn't really have much of an effect in overall     
33:17     
phenotype our data point towards robustness of the conserved par polarity Network that renders polarity access     
33:25     
specification resistant to variation both the strength of the Upstream symmetry breaking cues and Par protein     
33:33     
dosage so they're in development you have these symmetry braking cues but you also have this protein     
33:40     
dosage dependence where you have you know different amounts of power in the     
33:46     
cell and in the Mother cell and then that's so there's this resistance and     
33:52     
VAR to variations in these so this is this process that sort of Smooths over a     
33:57     
l of what's going on here analogously Downstream Pathways involving cell size     
34:03     
and fat symmetry a robust a dosage dependent changes in the local concentration of par proteins so this     
34:11     
means that we have these other Pathways that are acting on you know sort of as     
34:18     
instructive cues or cell size and for differences and fate so as the cells     
34:24     
differentiate we expect say for example a Mother cell that you two daughter cells but sometimes those daughter cells     
34:30     
will differentiate into different cell types sometimes they'll acquire different Fates so that's you know the     
34:37     
sort of asymmetry sometimes we have these uh cell- size cues so sometimes     
34:44     
purposefully cells will be maybe a little bit smaller a little bit larger than others and so this is something     
34:51     
that is you know maybe needed for development to proceed     
34:58     
and so what they're saying here is that these are uh these sorts of signals are     
35:04     
robust the dosage dependent changes in the local concentration of our protein so if we change the concentration of     
35:11     
this protein the dosage it will uh that those sorts of processes are robust to     
35:17     
this signal so it almost seems like there are these two different signals that you know multiple signals that are     
35:24     
occurring in the biology and in you know in     
35:31     
embryogenesis you have these mechanisms for robustness you have these mechanisms     
35:36     
that sort of override other mechanisms and that's that's kind of what they're kind of trying to unpack     
35:43     
here so this uh point point here about how these Downstream Pathways converge     
35:49     
and they're sort of robust these changes in protein concentration this implies     
35:55     
non-trivial complexity and transl par concentration profiles into pathway     
36:01     
outputs so there's this you know your concentration of this protein par it     
36:07     
acts sometimes as a signal sometimes the developmental processes robust the changes in that     
36:14     
signal may be a th stochastic and you have this sort of     
36:19     
this complexity in translating the concentration of power into outputs of     
36:26     
you know daughter cells and what the daughter cells are doing so uh dick has     
36:32     
this part outline uh highlighted here this uh sentence we propose that these     
36:38     
nonlinear signal response Dynamics between symmetry breaking par polarity     
36:44     
and asymmetric division modules effectively insulate each other or insulate each individual modules and     
36:52     
variation arising in others so if you have these different mechanisms or     
36:59     
different uh uh Gene regulatory networks they're all kind of acting independent     
37:08     
semi-independently they're exhibiting uh variation and they're sort of insulating     
37:14     
each other from this variation so I guess that means that they're sort of     
37:20     
correcting each other in maintaining this robust response in the     
37:25     
phenotype um this this decoupling helps maintain this embryo along the correct     
37:31     
or maintain the embryo along the correct developmental trajectory thereby ensuring the asymmetric division is     
37:38     
robust to foration so this again is where want to make sure that this asymmetric division     
37:46     
you know when these events are triggered that they don't lead to more variation in the in the lineage tree we also want     
37:53     
to M you know maintain that there not these multiplicative effects of noise so     
37:58     
that when you have different uh Gene regulatory Network Pathways interacting     
38:04     
that they're not amplifying the noise of development and those are all kind of in     
38:10     
the system so yeah Bradley there there's something that I'm not sure this paper     
38:16     
addressed it's an important question uh the uh especially in uh a mosaic     
38:23     
organism like seans and then is if you have an     
38:29     
asymmetric cell division and then the cells that are produced also have an     
38:34     
asymmetric cell division and there's an error in each one at each step why don't     
38:40     
the errors accumulate okay yeah and then not sure this paper     
38:46     
addressed that though they're beating around the bush about it     
38:52     
yeah yeah I guess they're just summar they're kind of summarizing it all as a sort of erir correction     
38:58     
mechanism yeah but what is the error correction mechanism that's what I'm getting at because I I'd expect in an     
39:05     
organism where most of the cells undergo an asymmetric cell division for the     
39:13     
errors to be accumulating accumulating and yet they don't     
39:22     
right yeah well let's see yeah let's see if they well I don't know they might talk about it in the okay see you know     
39:30     
as I said it's an important question but I'm not sure they have answered it     
39:38     
right right so they kind of talk about sort of robustness and and what's going     
39:45     
on there uh the robustness of phenotypic outcomes of many Origins and include     
39:51     
mechanisms that act at multiple scales of organization uh they talk about molecular buffering or dosage     
39:57     
compensation mechanisms and these can actually uh compensate for variance and network     
40:04     
components so you know sometimes you have dosages of say genes or proteins     
40:10     
that vary across uh you know embryos you might have a gene regulatory Network where     
40:16     
there is variation in the dosage you might have copies of genes that arise     
40:21     
and they might contribute to the sort of the output of the gene regulatory Network and so one way that that gets     
40:28     
sort of corrected for is to have this uh sort of comp variance compensation and     
40:35     
so they kind of talk about that these citations 6 through n uh Network     
40:41     
features such as activity dependent feedback saturation or kinetic linkage     
40:47     
can also ensure that input output functions of the network remain robust A     
40:52     
variation in particular components so this means that you have     
40:58     
these sort of different mechanisms like you know you have feedback in a in a     
41:03     
feedback loop and it depends on you know what kinds of you know what kinds of     
41:09     
things are being expressed what cells in the uh in the lineage tree are you know     
41:16     
you're looking at different cells in the lineage tree what are those uh and you know what is the activity relative to     
41:24     
those cells you have saturation where if you reach certain sort of stochiometry     
41:30     
of some protein or Gene that it sort of saturates and any more variation and     
41:35     
that doesn't really matter or I don't know I'm not familiar with Kinetic linkage but basically there     
41:42     
are these different mechanisms that allow the network to me     
41:47     
remain robust to variation Bradley suggestion here two gentlemen     
41:54     
have just joined us uh might want to consider this as a very important     
42:00     
project that they could Undertake and that is to test models of robustness     
42:06     
Maybe by simulating uh errors and how they accumulate during development and     
42:13     
whether or not and What mechanisms are possible for compensating fors     
42:20     
yeah I think I mean look the nematode has a thousand cells     
42:27     
uh or what is it 800 2,000 depending on yeah which kind it     
42:33     
is and by the time you accumulate errors you probably have a lot of error     
42:41     
accumulation because that's all coming from a single cell the egg and uh uh and     
42:48     
yet all nematodes of a given species look alike     
42:54     
right so how do they do it     
42:59     
okay I mean this paper as I said looks like it it says there are feedback mechanisms and whatnot but it doesn't     
43:05     
quantitate them and it doesn't show that the errors don't accumulate     
43:11     
yeah okay so modeling that might be very important because some models the errors     
43:18     
will accumulate and some they won't now I I do have a method that perturbs the embryo so much     
43:25     
that it can't do what what it's supposed supposed to uh yeah put in     
43:42     
here this is from 1991 defects due to compression of ampian embryos at primary     
43:48     
interal induction so this is where youur yeah has anyone grown a compressed     
43:55     
nematode oh yeah okay I mean you know this perturbed     
44:02     
this particular embryo that we were dealing with to the point it didn't work yeah and what you do is you just     
44:09     
compress it between two sheets of glass     
44:16     
yeah okay so you can exceed the ability of the embryo to compensate because     
44:22     
glass is stronger than embryos right     
44:28     
okay so we didn't kill it it     
44:34     
just reaches the point where it stops working so that that's that's way to     
44:40     
address the question and I suppose you could even simulate that if you can simulate the development with the error     
44:47     
of accumulation you could then simulate development between two glass sheets     
44:54     
because the EMB the cells are not allowed to go be those beyond the glass Mar yeah okay and so you can see what     
45:03     
happens uh and that might predict what would     
45:09     
happen to uh if no one's done the experiment might predict the     
45:14     
experiment yeah so yeah there was a question     
45:20     
um so if we use the hypergraph of seelan embryos in some way to change check     
45:27     
error accumulations yeah we could do that I mean the whole idea of hyper graphs the     
45:34     
way that we're kind of moving with them um is that hyper graphs allow us to look     
45:40     
at different levels of complexity so like you know we in in the hypergraph models that we have we have um like     
45:50     
different uh nodes which represent maybe like they could be gen gen genetic     
45:58     
regulatory Network outputs or they could be individual genes or they could be cells and then there's this hyper node     
46:06     
which represents sort of its class so you know you might have a class of genes     
46:12     
or a class of op or even like a set of a class of cells you know like a tissue so     
46:19     
we can model those at different levels so yeah you could actually do that sort of ver accumulation checking it would     
46:25     
just have you'd have to build the model so that you know you would in you know have a way to sort of introduce error     
46:33     
have it represented in the node and then see how it propagates through the network see how it affects the state of     
46:40     
the hyper node and things like that now I know both of you have been interested in this hyper graph work since that's     
46:47     
sort of the thing that we're going to be focusing on for the summer but I do have a preprint you can read and I'll send     
46:54     
I'll put it in the Maybe it's already been in the dorm slack Channel but I'll     
47:00     
reup it so you can read more about how we approach this problem so I'll do that     
47:07     
U but yeah this is something you can address with hypergraphs u what they're doing in this     
47:12     
paper is not it's different they're dealing with actually different types of networks they're dealing with Gene     
47:18     
regulatory networks and they're dealing with lineage trees which are directed     
47:23     
graphs so they're doing things with graphs and in networks here but yeah you     
47:28     
could use any you know different types of formulations I think uh hyper graph would be an interesting way to do that     
47:36     
because you sort of multi-level analysis yeah I think this is one of the     
47:41     
most fundamental questions in embryology uh it's it's a little spooky     
47:48     
because in a sense what you're saying the error correction mechanisms tell the embryo what it's     
47:56     
supposed to to do yeah and uh I it's a little hard to believe that the     
48:03     
individual cells know what they're supposed to do to produce the embryo now they one they way they might     
48:12     
do this is by some sort of global mechanism where each cell contributes to     
48:17     
some Global mechanism such as the electric Fields uh uh that Michael Levan has been     
48:25     
working on and those feedback so you get a global local feedback that controls     
48:32     
where the embryos uh what the embryo is     
48:37     
becoming okay but I don't know if that actually works yeah okay uh it's just a     
48:45     
speculation at this point so uh error accumulation     
48:51     
especially in organisms like this uh that are mosaic where you expect each     
48:58     
cell is supposed to do something but then if it makes an error a tiny error those errors why don't those     
49:06     
errors accumulate right okay it might be a global mechanism might be something     
49:13     
else so uh I'd really en encourage that we do some research along this direction     
49:21     
to see if we can discover how error accumulation is avoided     
49:29     
yeah you know for for organisms like us uh uh where many cells each cell type     
49:37     
consists of many cell types many many cells instead of uh just one as an an     
49:44     
nematode uh the problem becomes even worse yeah okay gonna say don't forget     
49:52     
the mechanics forget the mechanics but you see the what got me onto this is uh what     
50:02     
was his name Dennis dennet a philosopher who delved into uh uh into how uh     
50:12     
embryos might work he came up with a model of     
50:17     
trains uh constru like construction trains that build things right okay not     
50:24     
not Birds right okay and his model was that development preceded by one crane     
50:31     
working on top of another so a crane would hold a crane would hold a crane would hold a crane     
50:38     
but why doesn't the whole structure fall down because it'll accumulate errors if you ever try to for instance     
50:46     
balance well simple one where you build a a stack of of child child children's     
50:52     
blocks and you build a stack eventually it falls over okay and uh and it doesn't take that     
51:00     
many blocks for it to fall over because as precisely as you want to Stack the blocks if you don't get it just right     
51:06     
you're off er with each     
51:11     
one okay so that's that's sort of a model for uh uh for accumulative     
51:19     
errors you can you can try that if you have any kids in your family yeah     
51:28     
we just build it but uh so it's it's a real mystery as to what's what the actual mechanism is to control error     
51:36     
accumulation and some good modeling might be worthwhile doing to see what works and what     
51:42     
doesn't     
51:52     
yeah okay all right yeah so yeah this so that's kind of what they they don't yeah     
51:59     
I don't think they really get at that too much here they're just looking at these mechanisms so you know they talk     
52:05     
about the SE elegans which of course is this type of deterministic Mosaic     
52:11     
development where these uh lineage tree basically you know you have this binary     
52:18     
these binary division events and the divisions are deterministic in the sense     
52:23     
that we know what the cell should do when they divide they have a noren clature it doesn't vary across     
52:30     
individuals and ultimately those cells will reduce a certain tissue type or a certain cell type and so you know we we     
52:38     
have this which is basically a deterministic system but we do have this error that comes into play and there's     
52:45     
variation across cells and variation across different divisions and so then     
52:51     
that's what they're getting at here so in seans and related species     
52:57     
the first cell division is nearly always asymmetrical in both size and fate so     
53:02     
they're talking about that first division which produces a two cell embryo the ab lineage and the P1 lineage     
53:10     
and of course AB is anterior P1 is posterior and there's this asymmetry     
53:15     
that gets established there and so then that's where the first sort of asymmetry     
53:21     
uh emerges and then you get these other uh asymmetries or these synchronies     
53:27     
between cell divisions that produce um you know this this sort of symmetry breaking so that you get differences not     
53:35     
only in different sublineages but also like between divisions and those those     
53:42     
accumulate in a way that's not error error you know it just accumulates in terms of structure but you can have this     
53:50     
error these errors that accumulate as well um so basically you end up with the     
53:56     
Divergence in distinct lineages although the precise magnitude of these asymmetries can vary between species     
54:03     
though cell size a symmetry and cell size asynchron highly reproducible     
54:09     
within a given species so this is the case in seans but not in SE like mammals     
54:15     
where you have different sets of mechanisms at play there um moreover at least in seans     
54:21     
asymmetric division is robust to genetic and environmental perturbations including both temperature variation and     
54:29     
physical deformation so we talked about those where you can vary the temperature in development where the you know the     
54:36     
the embryo is being reared in like maybe 15 degrees cels versus 25 Dees cels or     
54:43     
you know where you're exposing it to physical deformation of some type well embryos can tolerate some variation in     
54:50     
cell size asymmetry and cell cycle asynchrony in part due to compensatory     
54:55     
Behavior years that Ur later in development you have these citations 34 through 36 the design principles which     
55:05     
go with that phrasing that underly this robustness of division asymmetry itself     
55:10     
remain largely unknown so they yeah they don't really talk about it they just want to get into the mechanistic study     
55:18     
and uh you know kind of talking about these par proteins which     
55:23     
are uh basically partitioning defective proteins so these are cell polarity     
55:29     
proteins that accumulate in cells in the mother cells par proteins consist of two     
55:36     
antagonistic groups of membrane Associated proteins that segregate into opposing anterior and posterior membrane     
55:44     
domains during the first division so what happens is you have the one cell embryo you have these per proteins that     
55:51     
are produced and they their membrane Associated proteins they move to each     
55:58     
end of that of that cell the anterior end and the posterior end they then the     
56:05     
cell divides segregation is triggered by a set of semi- redundant symmetry rig and qes so you get these par proteins     
56:12     
that move to opposite ends of the of the cell you get this uh process of     
56:20     
segregation that's triggered by the Symmetry breaking cues um and then you get this you know     
56:27     
it sort of depends on what the distribution of car proteins are so there's an initial distribution it     
56:33     
contributes to the diffusion of these proteins to different ends and then the     
56:38     
asymmetries are then reinforced and maintained a course set of feedback interactions to generate robustly     
56:45     
segregator and posterior par domains once form these par domains direct the     
56:51     
spatial organization of Downstream processes that orchestrate the size and     
56:56     
F symmetry of cell D so this is these part proteins are fundamental in sort of establishing the     
57:04     
larity and asymmetry in the lineage tree so you have you know these initial this     
57:11     
sort of initial division into two cells and then these par proteins continue to     
57:17     
sort of set the pace for that asymmetry throughout the lineage     
57:22     
tree and so then in this study they talk about sort of the way that par proteins     
57:27     
are regulated so there are a set of genes that regulate par protein um     
57:33     
production and segregation in the cell uh there are four genes that     
57:40     
restrict membrane Association anterior par proteins that are encoded by these four genes here AP pars Par 3 par six PK     
57:50     
C3 and cdc42 then you have uh also these uh par which are the     
57:58     
posterior par proteins par one par two lgl1 and Chin one so these four genes on     
58:06     
each side they sort of produce anterior pars and posterior pars and so you know there is this sort     
58:15     
of these genes that code for these different uh isoforms of par and then     
58:22     
they they end up segregating in a way that's uh functional     
58:27     
uh then so then basically the uh inhibition of these genes can actually     
58:32     
affect this feedback so the feedback is where you have a certain number of genes     
58:38     
expressed in the AP par category versus the parar category and I guess there has     
58:43     
to be a balance of those two and when there isn't or when there's you know in     
58:48     
in coming to that balance you get this positive and negative feedback and it's     
58:53     
reciprocal because you have basically competition between the aars and Par     
59:00     
pars so that's basically it's it's what they call mutually antagonistic feedback     
59:06     
and so par polarity generally relies on balancing apars and Par pars which act     
59:12     
via their respective polarity kinases PK C3 and Par one and so people have     
59:18     
mathematically modeled this sort of mutual antagonism and this predicts sensitivity to dosage changes which     
59:25     
manif as shifts in the membrane concentrations change relative domain sizes an ultimate     
59:32     
collapse of polarity depending on the magnitude of peration so these to recap these     
59:39     
different sorts of you know polarity is controll by these different classes of protein or actually these different     
59:45     
classes of protein their genes that are encoding these proteins and their     
59:51     
abundance you get this antagonistic feedback where you know you have the sort of balance between apars and     
59:58     
PS that controls different type this Mutual antagonism kind of controls     
1:00:03     
different processes these regulatory processes and if you perturb the embryo     
1:00:10     
it can make it can you know usually polarity is robust to these kind of     
1:00:16     
curvations but sometimes it can collapse based on the magnitude of perturbation     
1:00:22     
so often times if you perturb the cell you know in a very in a very white way     
1:00:28     
if the perturbation is is weak or moderate the cell the embryo can overcome that but if you have like dick     
1:00:35     
said this massive or catastrophic perturbation it can't     
1:00:42     
recover so basically you have this process polarization by cues so there     
1:00:48     
are these cues that uh allow for these different uh par complexes to separate     
1:00:54     
out then you have this antagonistic feedback so apar versus parar feedback     
1:01:00     
specifies the par domains pars and struct spindle position fading symmetry so basically the pars at     
1:01:07     
each end are specifying how the cell divides so you see that and when cells     
1:01:12     
divide you have this spindle the spindles have to be in a certain position they result in an symmetry or     
1:01:19     
asymmetry and then once cells divide the daughters are asymmetric in size and th     
1:01:26     
that's basically the model here and then you have of course the genotype where you have these genes the apars the P     
1:01:33     
pors there are four genes for each you have the protein dosage which results     
1:01:38     
from the gene expression or the abundance with the level of gene     
1:01:43     
expression results in protein dosage which results in protein abundance this     
1:01:48     
gives us polarity and then when we get a number of rounds of this polarity mechanism we     
1:01:55     
get size and fade asymmetry and then that can lead to differences in viability so if we have too much     
1:02:02     
asymmetry or not enough asymmetry in the embryo we can have inviable adults or     
1:02:09     
inviable uh worms basically they don't develop correctly and they don't survive     
1:02:15     
so that's kind of how this genetic mechanism can lead to sort of this organismal effect of     
1:02:22     
fitness and then of course they talk about robustness mechanisms see where you know you're balancing out     
1:02:29     
these different uh networks these different mechanisms and you know a     
1:02:35     
perturbation that that gets Amplified one is corrected by another one where     
1:02:40     
things are stable and you know they don't get into that too much but there's a sort of a systems question here that's     
1:02:48     
important the compensation of course and the network properties and this is where we get into a lot of the network     
1:02:56     
questions we were talking about there's a lot of uh literature on     
1:03:01     
robustness um and um you know a lot of things having to do where people have     
1:03:09     
kind of approached the question of robustness in biology from a network standpoint or from a complex system     
1:03:15     
standpoint and we might go over some of that work later just to get a sense of how people are thinking about that but I     
1:03:22     
think yeah there's definitely a link between sort of this robustness and then how different networks     
1:03:29     
represent that robustness and how you know how the network topology actually     
1:03:35     
plays a role in conferring robustness on the system so there's a lot of a lot of     
1:03:41     
jargon here in terms of how they're thinking about these mechanisms but um I     
1:03:47     
promise you there is a there is sort of a way to Way Forward here so yeah they do a lot of     
1:03:53     
mechanistic work in this paper and they don't I don't know if they come up with any strong     
1:04:00     
conclusions in the uh discussion here it looks like they     
1:04:09     
have so if we go back up to discussion here uh they talk about robustness     
1:04:17     
heterozygosity nonlinear dose response curves kind of talking about some of the     
1:04:22     
genetics of this and uh you know know kind of how overexpression can you know     
1:04:30     
there is this aspect of being robust overexpression and variations in gene expression which then of course leads to     
1:04:37     
this the Assembly of these par complexes and their segregation cells and how that     
1:04:43     
plays a role in conferring these these sorts of asymmetries so they kind of get     
1:04:49     
into some of this here uh then they say what do we mean when we say that the system is robust     
1:04:56     
so they get this is very sort of molecular in the molecular sense of How It's robust but basically it it confers     
1:05:04     
the system sort of this sort of uh resistance to being vulnerable to     
1:05:12     
stochastic changes in the environment these sort of fluctuations in the environment both molecular and out in     
1:05:20     
the external um and yeah they talk about critical     
1:05:26     
versus subcritical perturbations so not all perturbations are equal sometimes there are perturbations that can overcome these     
1:05:33     
robustness mechanisms and result in in a catastrophic failure of the system so     
1:05:40     
this is something that's really interesting as well not just that you can you know that you have the sort of     
1:05:46     
set of robustness mechanisms but there is this sort of nonlinearity where you have these you know     
1:05:53     
robustness that robustness only works up to a certain point and then you can have a     
1:05:59     
catastrophic uh perturbation that collapses the system or renders it     
1:06:06     
inviable um yeah so they get into the so yeah I don't think they really talk about the theory too much or about some     
1:06:13     
of the computational modeling they talk a little bit about mathematical modeling but not a     
1:06:20     
lot okay so that's I think that's enough um for today     
1:06:26     
looks like dick had to go but um again you know this is something for further     
1:06:32     
research and I think would' like to follow maybe follow up on this paper in the New Year especially some of these     
1:06:39     
mechanisms that we've talked about okay any questions or comments     
1:06:47     
before we do     
1:06:57     
you know it's a first day of the school year um but uh yeah very interesting and     
1:07:03     
um happy New Year everyone yeah happy new year thanks happy New Year yeah     
1:07:10     
yeah all right thanks for attending see you next     
1:07:17     
week bye bye take care T yeah you
