Transcripts:        
     
yeah yeah yeah so yeah so I been going through my previous work like uh I was     
0:26     
what what I was up to was previously dynamic hyperr and uh these metrics like     
0:32     
I actually tried a lot bunch of metrics now I'm like trying I'm forgetting little bit of what I did last time like     
0:39     
what metric meant what and in what context uh it can be relevant so uh I'm     
0:45     
still on it I don't have any updates on that like it's more of like I'm I'm     
0:51     
refreshing my memory and setting up the environment okay but I wanted to all     
0:56     
right so yeah um you think you can give a presentation on     
1:02     
on at some point uh soon or or yeah yeah because I think that     
1:07     
would be good go back and refresh what you know what happened last year and     
1:13     
give some more thoughts on it would be good yeah I think yeah I think that will be good can I do it next to next week on     
1:19     
uh on third of February yeah yeah I think so I think you can do it     
1:26     
uh next week uh we don't have anything else get so yeah it is like after like two after     
1:35     
14 days so it's like third third February yeah yeah oh okay oh so two     
1:42     
weeks yeah so this week I'm traveling and I might miss on it so don't want to     
1:47     
promise like next week so that is why I'm asking okay that's yeah I think so     
1:53     
that's good all right yeah that is it from my side all right that's it about Susan did     
2:01     
you have any more thoughts about those um 10 segr     
2:07     
stuff no I'm I've been building a another desk     
2:13     
here so that two people can work in this space use construction material behind     
2:20     
me there yeah um so I mostly got it done     
2:26     
I just have to do the wiring okay have done a new plugin for for it but     
2:35     
yeah so I might be in a different spot next week it'll be very close to this spot     
2:41     
but anyway now I sort of took a week off to try to straighten things up around     
2:48     
here yeah maybe it's going to take two or three weeks     
2:55     
maybe yeah so yeah no I um you haven't done     
3:01     
anything okay all right well     
3:08     
thanks all right so let's get started uh so last week we talked about the baa     
3:15     
iorm uh paper and I went back to the archives of the uh YouTube channel and I found that     
3:23     
there was this project called meta worm which was their pre-print of the paper     
3:30     
so they had that same group at a preprint and it was this uh different     
3:36     
name that they gave it and this was the paper where they had talked about uh the     
3:42     
different tools and they talked about open worm and I guess they used some of the openworm tools in the revision the     
3:48     
baa iorm revision and so that's that's what we covered last week we went over their     
3:55     
model and what they did the multicompartments of of the brain then the body environment and all that     
4:02     
so um I just wanted to give sort of a a little bit more context for     
4:09     
that gu had a a comment about um some     
4:14     
other things on YouTube I'll have to bring them up at some point okay um     
4:19     
thank you soan so that's that's what's going on there uh let me go back and     
4:27     
today I think we're going to uh go over two papers maybe a little bit about one     
4:32     
and maybe focus on another so this one here is um diverging     
4:40     
Network architecture of the celegans connectto and signaling Network this is a paper uh by some Network scientists     
4:48     
who are doing um I think they're all Network scientists uh they're doing neuroscience     
4:54     
and network science um and they're going to be talking about two different types of celan's connectone one is a     
5:02     
connectone based on I I guess like synaptic connections and the other based     
5:08     
on signaling between cells and of course we've talked about networks in uh like     
5:15     
embryo networks where you have cells and aren't neurons and one of the connectivity Criterion for that can be     
5:21     
some sort of uh signaling between the cells so you have all sorts of uh     
5:27     
signaling Pathways and extra cellular signaling Pathways that affect where one     
5:32     
cell can affect another cell you have endocrine signaling you have jocine signaling and all these other types of     
5:39     
signals that can be sent between cells and so their distance uh determines how     
5:44     
well they can receive those cells and so that's that's happening in the connectome at the same time that you     
5:51     
have this chemical connectivity through synapses and of course the physical electrical connectivity through Gap     
5:58     
Junctions so in this paper they're going to talk about some of these um you know divert     
6:06     
what they call diverging Network architectures so you'll have basically     
6:12     
two the same set of cells but two different connectivity Criterion to     
6:18     
distinguish those separate sort of parallel networks and so sometimes they're going to have the same     
6:24     
connections and sometimes they're going to have different connections and so uh let's go to the     
6:30     
abstract here so they start by saying that the     
6:36     
connectome describes the complete set of synaptic contacts the origin Neons communicate     
6:43     
while the architecture of the seans connecto has been extensively characterized much less is known about     
6:49     
the organization of causal signaling networks arising from functional interactions between neurons so you know     
6:57     
people have determined of of course in celegans you can do this determine the     
7:02     
full connecto every you know neuron and their connections you know in different ways     
7:10     
but we don't necessarily know about the signaling networks that cause things and     
7:15     
the interactions between neurons that result from those signaling networks you get signaling networks that     
7:22     
produce uh things that affect the synapse and the uh you know things in     
7:28     
the Gap Junction but you you don't have a mapping of those uh like messenger networks outside     
7:36     
the cell so that's what they're trying to do here understanding how effective communication Pathways relate to or     
7:43     
diverge from the underlying structure is a central question in Neuroscience here we analyze the modular     
7:50     
architecture of the celan signal propagation Network measured via calcium Imaging and     
7:57     
optogenetics and compared to the underlying anatomical wiring measured by electron microscopy so they're going to     
8:04     
be doing this they're going to be looking at the signal propagation Network through calcium Imaging and     
8:11     
optogenetics and then they're going to look at this anatomical wiring by electron microscopy so they're going to     
8:17     
have these two different measures of how to do this compared to the mic uh compared to     
8:23     
the connect Elm we find that the signaling modules are not aligned with the modular boundaries of the anatomical     
8:29     
Network highlighting an instance where function deviates from structure an exception to     
8:35     
this is the ferx which is the wnated into a separate community in both anatomy and     
8:40     
Signal we analyze the cellular compositions of signaling architecture and find that it is modules that are     
8:47     
enriched for specific cell types and functions suggesting that the network modules are neurobiologically     
8:54     
relevant lastly we identify Rich Club of Hub neurons in the signaling Network     
9:00     
and then this is this Rich club that people have identified in the celegans connect on these are cell or neurons     
9:07     
that are highly connected to other neurons and they form this sort of set of hubs that do a lot of the heavy     
9:15     
lifting in the the connectone so you get cells that are you know key inter     
9:21     
neurons uh that that process a lot of information between different parts of     
9:26     
the uh neural network in the in the C Elegance so you know it's it's like a     
9:33     
small subset of neurons that perform these outsized roles you see the same     
9:39     
thing in these signaling networks you see Rich clubs of Hub neurons that receive signals and that respond in kind     
9:46     
and those networks even though they have a different topology or different connectivity they still and I don't know     
9:54     
they I don't know on the paper if they identify them as the same neurons but basically they have this Rich Club as     
10:01     
well in this kind of a network the membership of the signaling Rich Club differs from the rich Club detected in     
10:06     
the anatomical Network challenging The View that structural hubs occupy positions of influence in functional     
10:14     
networks so this is okay so they actually say that this in this case the     
10:19     
signaling Rich Club differs from the rich Club detected in the anatomical Network challenging The View that     
10:25     
structural hubs occupy positions of influence in functional signaling networks so this is where you get this     
10:32     
Divergence again between the two networks our results provide new insight     
10:38     
into the interplay between brain structure in the form of a complete synaptic level connecto and brain     
10:44     
function in the form of a systemwide causal signal propagation an okay so that's what they're doing     
10:51     
here so basically to recap you have these these networks that the same set     
10:58     
of nodes and you're using two different criteria to characterize them one which is uh     
11:05     
this sort of structural characterization in this case with the connect and one     
11:11     
which is functional which is the signaling Network and you see that they have even though they have the same     
11:18     
neurons and the neurons have a connectivity which is functional at the level of the synapses and the Gap     
11:25     
Junctions that the signaling network is going to have a different topology and     
11:30     
that you know you can have like if we think about the connectone we think about it as being connected in the way     
11:37     
that we can sort of identify the connections between cells and then that's all the connectivity they have     
11:43     
but in this case what they're saying is that there's this signaling layer which has a different sort of structure of     
11:51     
connectivity and it doesn't necessarily overlap with what's going on in these     
11:58     
say synaptic or Gap Junction mediated connector okay so they basically say how     
12:06     
the structure of a biological system supports its functional repertoire is a central question in biology a defining     
12:14     
feature of this question is that it seeks to relate two lenses into the same biological system so they mean is that     
12:21     
you want to be able to see if there's this you know set of functions in a     
12:27     
biological system and uncover all of them and are they all align in the same     
12:32     
direction uh basically make taking two lenses into the same biological system     
12:37     
through these different systems different measurements of these systems and looking at them and saying you are     
12:44     
they sort of consistent or not in Neuroscience the relevant structural lens is the network map of     
12:51     
synaptic Connections in the brain called a connected and so that's what we think of     
12:57     
when we think about the wiring of the nervous system the functional lens is given by Network     
13:02     
maps that report how the activity of one neuron in the brain either relates to or     
13:07     
influences the activity of others these can be measured by functional MRI     
13:13     
electrophysiology or calcium imag Network science provides a powerful toolkit to characterize and distill Key     
13:21     
properties of these networks there has been an implicit hypothesis that since Network properties     
13:27     
capture fundamental features of the brain they should persist across both of these lenses so again you know we want to have     
13:34     
this consistency but we often don't get it however in studies of humans there is     
13:39     
evidence that Network properties can differ sometimes dramatically between function and structure including     
13:46     
measures of centrality and community structure so this is where this connectivity and this consistency of     
13:53     
connectivity becomes important because in the network you looking at the nodes you're looking at how they're connected     
13:59     
and those connections direct or indirect will have an effect on different network     
14:05     
indicators or measures uh centrality of course being how Central a node is to the network and     
14:13     
community structure is how tightly nodes are connected to one another uh sort of     
14:19     
locally or you know they're able to form you know discrete subsystems like     
14:24     
modules or other types of things and it's a hard thing sometimes to detect communities and networks is you often     
14:31     
have to use algorithms to say whether this one set of uh this one subset of     
14:36     
nodes is more connected than any other subset of nodes and whether that has some implication for functional     
14:44     
coherence so in other words if we're looking at a subsystem that we suspect is involved in feeding behaviors we     
14:52     
might look at a number of neurons that are candidate neurons and then look at how you know tightly they're connected     
14:58     
in network setting and if we find that they're they form this community we     
15:04     
might say okay there's a community or a module in in the Clans nervous system for feeding so this is why this is     
15:12     
important but of course if we have these two different Criterion for defining a     
15:17     
network those community structure can be even harder to sort of implicate in any     
15:23     
kind of behavior or any kind of functional consequence so the give some citations     
15:30     
for these measures here uh and this is basic Network Theory Network science     
15:36     
stuff but it's I think it's relevant here because it has you know I think we need to think more deeply about these     
15:42     
kinds of measures and how depending on how we're using our     
15:47     
networks uh or implementing our networks how they are measured and how what they     
15:54     
mean okay so uh therefore to the extent of which properties of the brain     
16:00     
structural Network match properties of its functional Network how do you know this remains     
16:05     
unclear especially at the brain scale and cular level so if we have these two     
16:11     
overlapping but diverging networks you know are they giving us you     
16:17     
know the same signals are they really telling us as much as we think they are about the functional networks and the     
16:24     
structural networks that we're deriving at any one scale so that's basically it     
16:30     
and you know in previous work we've introduced this concept of diverging     
16:36     
integration for Divergent integration which is where in the embryo you have     
16:41     
these cells that differentiate into neurons into uh somatic cells and they     
16:48     
diverge in terms of their function and they form different networks but they're networks that are connected at some key     
16:55     
point so if you have a bunch of sematic cells and neurons that are sort of Neighbors     
17:02     
in embryogenesis and then they diverge they migrate a little bit and then they change their fate to different you know     
17:09     
form different networks as they become adults those     
17:14     
cells diverge in terms of their functionality they diverge in terms of their network     
17:20     
connectivity but they remain connected because they're part of the same organism so they're kind of hitting on this theme as well and um it's it's     
17:28     
interesting because we often don't think about we often think of networks as static in the sense of you know how     
17:35     
we're defining them we say okay this is a connecto this is what it looks like it's you know that's what it is but in     
17:43     
in fact connectomes have their origins in different types of cells they have different functional     
17:50     
attributes which make them harder to     
17:55     
understand okay so they talk about how we can measure the connectone we can     
18:01     
measure it through sort of these synaptic connections and through Gap     
18:06     
Junctions we also need to look at gene expression neurom modulators we need to look at uh     
18:14     
functional Connections in the absence of wiring like extra synaptic signaling so     
18:20     
we have these peptidergic actually we do have a peptidergic connectome that     
18:25     
exists and that peptidergic connectome is where you have peptidergic signaling or signaling via peptides and peptides     
18:33     
are a lot less um you know they're a lot more promiscuous than synaptic     
18:41     
transmission so you get these peptides that are released and they diffuse     
18:46     
through the extra cellular millu to activate other neurons so you can have these poly synaptic     
18:53     
Pathways that are activated through these peptidergic connections so that's another kind of     
19:00     
example of sort of going Beyond of your typical set of synaptic connections or     
19:07     
Gap Junctions to look at how signaling affects um you know a greater portion of     
19:14     
the network and actually changes how we understand the connectivity but for my     
19:19     
understanding the peptidergic connectome is is pretty consistent with the regular     
19:26     
connector and so you know um there are all these different mechanisms that we can look to to     
19:32     
measure to get some nuance and what what exactly the connectome is doing and what     
19:37     
exactly it looks like okay so it's but this also makes it     
19:43     
challenging to translate between the networks of structure and function so so that gets into their work here     
19:51     
they investigate and compare the properties of both networks wearing and signaling focusing on their community     
19:56     
structure and Rich Club properties     
20:04     
so what they're looking at is they're looking at the connectome uh while the connecto encodes     
20:10     
only direct synaptic connections between neurons the signaling Network captures effective connections that arise from     
20:17     
the combined effect of not only direct connections but also all interactions     
20:22     
that spand multiple hops with the anatomical Network or poly synaptic chains this is also t or this is also     
20:30     
TRX or synaptic signaling that is not constrained to flow along synapses so they did this where they uh     
20:38     
considered binarized direct connecto and signaling networks of the same head neurons so they took you know they took     
20:46     
each neuron and they considered actually they took 188 neurons from the connectone and they considered them head     
20:53     
neurons and so from this 10 subset of 180 head neurons they considered them to     
21:00     
have sort of you know they started with the same head neurons that have had different numbers of edges so they     
21:07     
started with sort of a root of the network and then they sort of reconfigured it um according to kind of     
21:16     
different criteria thus the networks differed in terms of their density and their distribution of motifs so they had     
21:23     
these different types of networks that they started they started with head neurons and then they considered these     
21:29     
binarized directly connectto and signaling networks and they ended up with a bunch of uh you know alternate     
21:35     
networks that gave different numbers of edges so they had 100 or     
21:41     
1,151 edges for the signaling Network and 3,250 edges for the connector so     
21:47     
that just means how many connections there are between neurons starting at these head neurons and moving down and     
21:54     
so the signaling uh network was much sparser than the connect them from what     
21:59     
I understand from this so that means that these networks are different in terms of their density     
22:06     
the signaling Network where the density of the signaling network is much lower than the density of the uh anatomical     
22:15     
Network and then the distribution motifs is different as     
22:20     
well a question yeah is the smaller Network a subset of     
22:27     
the larger Network uh well it's it's in terms of the uh     
22:33     
nodes yes uh     
22:38     
yeah okay go ahead okay so the clustering coefficient is     
22:45     
also lower in the signaling Network it's a bit less than half of the anatomicals     
22:52     
cluster anatomical Network's clustering coefficient as we might expect we also     
22:57     
know that celegans connect them through connections the sort of the what we call     
23:03     
the anatomical network is a small world Network which is where you have this     
23:09     
path length across the network which is relatively short given the amount of connectivity you have given the a number     
23:15     
of nodes and so the small world network is where you can take any one node or     
23:21     
neuron and get to any other neuron in a relatively small number of hops and so     
23:27     
this is something that we also find in the signaling Network It's a Small World Network and so we     
23:35     
find this for these head networks um so both of these types of networks are small world but they have     
23:41     
different properties in their     
23:48     
connectivity so they talk about the neural networks being hierarchically subdivided into sub networks a lot of     
23:56     
times people call these modules or commun ities or clusters uh this is of course important     
24:02     
for function but you know it's it's a key Hallmark of     
24:07     
structure uh this provides a balance but of course we know that like these uh     
24:13     
subnetworks aren isolated they have connections between them this is why we     
24:18     
can observe the small world Behavior we can observe these uh different     
24:23     
properties of networks that you know uh     
24:29     
where you can go from one end of the network or one end of the whole network to the other relatively in a short path     
24:36     
length because we have key connections between sub     
24:41     
networks uh this provides a balance between segregation into specialized functional units and integration of     
24:47     
information across neural distant neural elements therefore informs how the nervous system performs computations     
24:58     
so they tested whether the anatomical and signaling descriptions of the celegans brain shared a similar module     
25:04     
structure we used a hierarchical variant of the stochastic block model they     
25:09     
independently subdivide the wiring and signaling networks and nested communities a stochastic block model is     
25:15     
the sampling technique that people often use to subdivi artificially subdivide a     
25:21     
network and test out different uh structural motifs and     
25:27     
structural instances to look at their function look at their structure so they use this kind of     
25:33     
approach block model approach we found Stark differences in the modular organization of these two     
25:39     
views into the Sean's brain the anatomical connectone was clustered into 20 communities in the first hierarchical     
25:46     
level with the smallest containing only one neuron and the largest containing 20 so this is where you have these     
25:53     
different communities uh you can get from like a community of one neuron which isn't really that interesting to communities     
26:01     
of 20 which is you know maybe more functionally satisfying um in contrast the signal     
26:07     
propagation network was optimally partitioned and so this is uh figure one     
26:14     
this shows the hierarchical modular structure of the c el signaling propagation in anatomical Network so     
26:20     
this shows the anatomical Network in a and this shows a signaling Network in B     
26:26     
so you can see that they use this sort of circular layout for their Network     
26:32     
they have these different sub networks here that are numbered I guess these are the     
26:37     
communities uh let's see if what they say in the yeah uh sorted by Community     
26:45     
assignment so in this case they have from 1 to 20 so you can see on the on     
26:52     
the chart here that they go around there's connectivity     
26:58     
uh across you know across communities there's connectivity within the communities of course so this just shows     
27:05     
the structure and you know how it differs in terms of connecting across communities     
27:12     
so for the anatomical Network we have this Matrix which is post synaptic versus PR synaptic basically the pr     
27:19     
synaptic communities connect to the post synaptic communities at some density and you can see that some are more highly     
27:26     
connected than others you can see that in the circular plot as well and for the     
27:31     
signaling networks you see it's much more sparse we knew that from the     
27:37     
statistics we can see that in the circular plot that it's much less dense in terms of uh     
27:44     
connectivity you still get this sort of connectivity between communities     
27:49     
um you know and you also get this in the um in The Matrix as well where we     
27:56     
see uh community 5 to five and one: one are very densely connected and the rest     
28:03     
you know are varying degrees of sparcity so this is interesting uh just thinking     
28:10     
about like the differences between these networks and what that might mean for     
28:16     
function so they give a list of communities here in the signaling Network what's in each community so we     
28:24     
have a lot of the uh I2 and I3 and I4 uh I2     
28:30     
neurons the m m M1 M2 and M3 neurons uh we have some of the NSM     
28:39     
neurons and the r y VR neuron so that's in community one Community 2     
28:46     
has uh ur yvl ur ydl     
28:51     
i2d so you start to get like things that are um sort of similar what's in     
28:58     
community one sometimes it's the bilateral pair but most of the time they're you know you don't see too many     
29:06     
bilateral pairs in in the same Community which is interesting you see IL r and i     
29:12     
i1 l and I uh i1r in the same uh community and two you     
29:19     
see il1 DL and i1d are in the same community so you see bilateral pairs in     
29:25     
community 2 but not in community 1 so much Community 3 you see some asymmetry in     
29:33     
terms of the lateral pairs afd is only the left one aim is only the left one     
29:39     
aiy is only the left one AI well actually aiy has the bilateral pair an     
29:45     
asj only has left one and so on and so forth so you sometimes see these     
29:51     
bilateral pairs in the same Community sometimes they're not which is suggest something     
29:56     
interesting uh from a functional standpoint if we went to the anatomical     
30:02     
connectone we would see that there sometimes the left neuron is doing something a little bit different from     
30:07     
the what the right neuron is doing uh sometimes if you look at like when they     
30:13     
differentiate and development the left one differentiates before the right one     
30:18     
uh at least it's as detected uh through the methods that we have so there are these asymmetries that we know that     
30:25     
exist in the connectome in terms of when a cell originates how it's wired and     
30:31     
then also apparently the signaling relationships between     
30:38     
them uh then okay so they have this part on the distribution of bilateral pairs     
30:43     
across communities so a majority of the celan neurons consist of bilateral     
30:48     
asymmetric pairs that are often connected to each other via Gap Junctions they tend to have similar gene     
30:54     
expression wiring and correlated activity patterns so we expect these     
30:59     
bilateral pairs since they come usually from the same Mother cell in development     
31:05     
and they have the same nomenclature they usually have the same type of functional role on either side of the Worm but you     
31:13     
know they again they have differences in terms of their uh their     
31:18     
behavior but you know we want to look to these kinds of pairs because they seem     
31:24     
to be the most similar you know neurons in each part of the connectone right versus left so we     
31:31     
have this uh we have this test that we can do which is to look at the biolateral asymmetric neurons and see if     
31:38     
they're in these same communities or if they're doing the same things in the network or if they're doing different     
31:43     
things in the as we would expect bilaterally asymmetric neurons are much more likely     
31:49     
to be found in the same communities that are across then across different communities so they actually say that     
31:56     
they find that you go systematically through this bilateral asymmetric neurons are much more likely to be found     
32:02     
in the same communities and this is in the uh in the function in the anatomical     
32:08     
networks much more likely to be found in the same communities than across different communities for both the     
32:14     
anatomical and signaling networks in the anatomical Network bilateral neuron pairs were 38 times more likely to be in     
32:21     
the same Community than in different communities and in the signaling Network they were twice as likely which means     
32:28     
that they uh there's a difference we were looking at the signaling networks we saw that we had sometimes we had     
32:34     
pairs that were not symmetrical in the sense of being in the same community so     
32:39     
the signaling Network Maybe by virtue of being less uh you know less uh dense being     
32:48     
more sparse but maybe also because it's more promiscuous in terms of the     
32:54     
signal um that it is less likely but also twice it's actually okay so it's     
33:00     
twice as they're twice as likely as just random neurons to be in the same     
33:06     
Community but they're also much less likely than uh anatomical networks to     
33:12     
have those bilateral pairs be in the same community so it's a little     
33:17     
confusing but basically bilateral neuron pairs are almost always in the same Community 38     
33:24     
times more than like random cells if you were to take any two cells that weren't of the same sort of uh bilateral pairing     
33:34     
then it would be 308 atts more likely in the signaling networks they're twice as more uh twice as likely they're using     
33:41     
that same Criterion but that's much less of course than the anatomical     
33:46     
level this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that some features should be concerned across both     
33:54     
Network descriptions so we should have this conservation across Network     
33:59     
descriptions uh but it's going to vary because of nature of these     
34:09     
networks okay so they they give     
34:17     
uh okay so switch gears here uh to finish up this paper by talking about     
34:24     
how communities are enriched for neuron type and rooll um clustering of anatomical networks has     
34:31     
previously been used to identify communities of neurons that are enriched for cell types or known functional     
34:37     
cellular roles including dropa and celant uh so we've seen this in     
34:43     
different organisms in these model organisms where we know what the cell     
34:49     
types are we can build a model with the connectone pretty easily across individuals we have these archetype     
34:56     
connectomes consistent with prior findings our module clustering of the seigan anatomical Network recapitulates     
35:04     
anatomical communities that are each significantly enriched for more no more than one of the three seelan neuron type     
35:11     
classes sensory inter and motor neurons so what they're looking for here is     
35:17     
they're looking for I guess they're looking for these rich Club networks um and     
35:24     
so yeah and so uh similar they're each enriched for no more than one of five     
35:30     
predefined cell roles and so they they give this figure     
35:38     
here which is figure three communities are enriched for neuron type enroll so they show this example here     
35:46     
where they have these are their six communities for the signaling Network     
35:52     
they show that for sensory inter and motor neurons you have these different     
35:57     
memberships in the signaling uh uh communities and you see that the zcore     
36:04     
is variable across here for Community 2 uh you have a zcore of four for     
36:11     
sensory neurons and uh negative zcore for intern motor     
36:16     
neurons uh in community one you have a high zcore for motor neurons and a low z     
36:22     
score for sensoring interneurons Community 3 has a lot of motor neurons     
36:28     
four has interneurons and then five doesn't have has a almost a zero zcore for all three     
36:36     
and then I guess that suggests that it's well mixed in that sense and then uh     
36:41     
High moderate zcore for sensory neurons in community     
36:46     
6 uh then they have this uh for other like they break out the neuron types A     
36:53     
little bit more finely foral neurons ampid sensory locator inter which is are     
37:00     
just inter neurons VNC motor neurons ring inter neurons and all others and     
37:05     
they show this similar variation across communities showing that there's uh you     
37:11     
know I guess what this means is that there are a greater number of different types of neurons in certain communities     
37:18     
over others some communities specialize in certain cell types whereas other     
37:24     
communities specialize in other cell types which is what you might expect to find if you're using a community     
37:29     
detection method and you're trying to find like communities that are sort of     
37:36     
connect you know do basically the same types of things or you know expect a     
37:41     
mapping between fun uh function and structure so you know if you have a lot     
37:46     
of structural similarities between a set of neurons you might expect functional     
37:52     
uh similarities as well and so this shows this for the anatom IAL networks you see the same     
37:59     
sort of pattern you know of course we have different communities here so we're     
38:04     
going to have you know some communities that's that have more an EMP have an     
38:10     
emphasis towards Sensory neurons uh some towards interneurons and some towards motor neurons and this     
38:18     
holds true for this breakout of function as well so for fingio for ampid sensory     
38:24     
locator in VNC motor bring in and all other you see the same     
38:30     
pattern so this is getting us to this Rich Club of neurons and to get to the     
38:35     
rich Club of neurons we have to understand sort of these Community interactions so we have assortative     
38:42     
disassortative and core periphery interactions um and so this the     
38:48     
assortative are where you have neurons that sort of assort by some     
38:54     
Criterion uh where they you know maybe join some highly connected cell where     
39:00     
they join like cells in a community and this basically serves a purpose of sorting the network so the network     
39:07     
connectivity is defined by sort of like cells or by cells that have a high     
39:12     
connectivity and it sorts the network in a way that's has you know has these this     
39:18     
sort of natural structure like this and it disassortative uh sort of organization     
39:24     
you have cells that connected just random cells and you don't really have very much structure that results from     
39:30     
that the core periphery model is where you have this very strong signal for     
39:36     
connecting to core or these rich Club neurons and that's where you have these     
39:41     
green stars surrounded by these n network nodes that are peripheral so the     
39:46     
peripheral nodes will much more likely connect to these starred net neurons or these core neurons which then end up     
39:53     
being these rich Club neurons and you form this strong core periphery     
39:58     
structure and so you see in in both in terms of signal propagation in     
40:04     
anatomical networks that you have a similar sort of breakdown of     
40:09     
connectivity types so in Signal propagation or when we form our network     
40:15     
based on Signal propagation the assortive network uh Motif is found in 68% of the     
40:23     
network the core of the network involves 14% of neuron neurons that are connected     
40:28     
together and then these peripheral neurons consist of 18% of the structure so this core     
40:35     
periphery structure forms about uh 32% of the network connectivity     
40:43     
and the assortative part forms 68% in terms of anatomy we have the     
40:49     
coron periphery drop to a combined uh percentage of about     
40:54     
19% you have this 4% dis so this assort of uh connectivity Motif and then for     
41:02     
assortative you have 77% so this is both because the network is less uh you know it's more sparse and     
41:10     
it's also uh more promiscuous in terms of its connectivity you see a small amount of disassortative connectivity     
41:17     
but you see a greater amount of assortative connectivity as opposed to this uh core periphery connectivity     
41:24     
which is indicative of these vir clubs so I think that's all for that paper uh     
41:30     
I just wanted to really kind of give a strong review of that paper and and kind     
41:36     
of go deeply into it to show how we might look at network connectivity for     
41:43     
different types of connectivity Criterion and what that means for what     
41:49     
we think of as the connector okay uh looks like we lost mul     
41:57     
and soam uh we'll press on so this second paper     
42:04     
um and we'll go over this more quickly is this paper worm ID     
42:11     
Benchmark so this is extracting whole brain neurodynamics of celegans at the neuron     
42:18     
resolution okay so the abstract of this paper is the nemone celegans is a well     
42:24     
studied model organism for characterizing the structure connectivity and function of a complete     
42:30     
nervous system so we again like in the last paper we can use different types of     
42:35     
methods to extract different types of information from any sort of thing from     
42:42     
the biology we want uh within you know within a scope     
42:47     
of you know we so we can extract connectomes that are you know these     
42:52     
chemical or physical connections we can extract neuron or connect omes that are     
42:58     
epad deric we can extract them that are you know s different types of signaling modes we can do a lot of things like     
43:06     
that uh we have a lot of new methods in 3D light microscopy and fluorescent     
43:11     
protein tagging that it brought us closer to capturing capturing the neural dynamics of the worm atary     
43:18     
resolution nevertheless capturing a complete map of neural Dynamics using these high resolution recordings     
43:24     
requires solving three specific challenges so you know this is not without its     
43:31     
issues I mean they've applied these methods and gotten data but there are three challenges that really probably     
43:38     
still need to be overcome uh the first is detection of individual neurons and fluoresence     
43:44     
videos and we know that from our own work with trying to segment cells follow     
43:50     
the fluorescence signal make sure that the fluorescent signal is INS spous etc     
43:55     
etc to identification of those neurons according to their anatomically defined     
44:01     
classes in other words how do you map what we know from say like the light     
44:09     
microscopy which defined the really early studies in C elans to some of     
44:14     
these other methods where you have to track the cell we have to know what cell is this specific cell type and follow it     
44:25     
across different individual worms and across different individual um     
44:31     
observations and three tracking of neural positions over time so you know     
44:38     
when we get our connecto we want to be able to track the you know if especially if we     
44:46     
have a behaving where those neural positions are going to change we're going to want to see you     
44:52     
know across function and across development especially     
44:58     
successfully addressing these challenges with high sensitivity specificity and throughput can enable us to analyze a     
45:04     
large population sample providing unprecedented insights into the structure and function of an entire     
45:10     
brain at single neuron resolution so we have not been able to do this really in any other model     
45:17     
organism uh maybe because cgans is such a fabulous model organism but also     
45:23     
because you know this is a I guess this is probably something where we have a     
45:29     
decent Siz connectome along with the ability to do this uh to know what the     
45:35     
cells are and to track things accordingly in culture to facilitate the scientific     
45:43     
goal we have curated publicly available annotated data sets from 118 worms across five distinct Laboratories and     
45:50     
established systematic benchmarks decomposing the overarching objective into three well-defined tasks so those     
45:57     
are neural detection neural identification and spatio temporal tracking so looking at     
46:04     
these things in time and in space as they move the organisms move sometimes     
46:09     
the cells migrate identification which is where you want to correctly identify the cell     
46:16     
and then detecting something that is a neuron versus non a neuron our preliminary analysis has     
46:22     
revealed considerable room for improvement in existing state-of-the-art comp computational methods consequently     
46:29     
we envision that our worm ID Benchmark can catalyze efforts across a broad by a broad audience specializing in computer     
46:37     
vision to develop robust and accurate methods that significantly enhance the throughput of generating annotated whole     
46:44     
neural Dynamics data sets we make our Benchmark results reproducible our code     
46:50     
is available on GitHub this is the GitHub repository here this is worm andd     
46:57     
all right so let's go through the repository um so this repository contains the code necessary to reproduce     
47:04     
the results and Analysis in the wor andd this is uh from nurs 2024 and this is     
47:10     
The Benchmark paper I think this P paper was published on bioarchive yeah so this was actually a     
47:17     
neuro uh neur IPS paper in 2024 to clone this repository with all     
47:24     
included subm modules run get clone recur subm modules in the command line     
47:29     
uh or run get subm module update to selectively clone specific subm modules     
47:36     
so they have different sorts of tasks that you can do to to run this the first     
47:42     
is Neuron Center detection so the first Benchmark is where they'll take a neurop pal imagees input and predict the     
47:49     
location of each neuron we evaluated two classical models for cell segmentation     
47:54     
tasks there are cell pose and mic micro Sam so Sam is the segment anything model     
48:00     
so they actually we talked about sellos and micro Sam from the Google summer of code uh you know period where we're     
48:09     
trying to find the right algorithm to do segmentation they're using two     
48:14     
popular uh you know biological segmentation algorithms here so they're     
48:21     
going to use these two classical models uh you download the data you pre-process it     
48:27     
you run inference py and evaluate. py which should be in the     
48:33     
repository um and then you run those for each individual model then you aggregate     
48:38     
the results of the valuate py and the neuron detection data sets so that's the first one and you're detecting the     
48:45     
center of a neuron with this method task two is Neuron pel neuron     
48:51     
identification that's where we have our ID Benchmark uh uh notebook     
48:57     
and this contains the code for running the analyses presented in The Benchmark paper once the results have been     
49:03     
produced for each model so they look at this uh technique     
49:08     
coherent Point drift and they Implement coherent Point drift using this paper     
49:13     
here which is uh introducing this this method this code can be found in the fdn     
49:19     
C neuron ID subm module which is up in this part of the like this one these are all empty uh for for this for purposes     
49:28     
of this repository we have to call the repository and then that's going to be a working repository for that test so this     
49:36     
is for this um cerent Point drift test to     
49:42     
reproduce the benchmarking results use the Run CPD uh notebook script to     
49:48     
generate the result CSV files Rel to data pads are in the Run CPD notebook     
49:54     
file these pads assume that the data folder is at the root level of this     
49:59     
repository they need may need to be changed if the data is in another place in your local file system statistical     
50:06     
analysis uh the code for this analysis can be found in the nwb elegans     
50:12     
repository presented in sprag all this is this P bioarchive paper further     
50:17     
details on the model itself can be found in the original statistical Atlas paper which is shown     
50:22     
here and this is uh contain this this script contains the code for retraining     
50:28     
the statistical Atlas and generating The Benchmark results um so this Atlas     
50:35     
here is the statistical atlas of cigan neurons and it uses uh neurop pal which     
50:44     
is a means for a correct uh assigning the correct identities to all neurons in the     
50:49     
worm via deterministic fluorescent color map so this is a neurop palis is a     
50:55     
common way to identify cells and the idea is to sort of retrain     
51:03     
the statistical Atlas on your data and generate those results and see how well that     
51:10     
you um then there's CRF ID so the mat lab code for CRF ID is provided as a     
51:16     
subm module um this method is found in this paper on     
51:21     
elif which is this graphical model framework for automated annotation of cell identities     
51:27     
and dense cellular images CRF stands for conditional random Fields this is a     
51:33     
probabilistic graphical model framework that allows us to do unbiased and automated     
51:39     
cell identification so they test this on cagans in this     
51:45     
paper but they reproduce in this paper in this in this using this gith up     
51:52     
repository okay uh and then finally task three is neuron tracking and hovering calcium Imaging so in this task we will     
52:00     
take calcium video data for CGM and the ground truth neuron     
52:06     
locations at the reference frame as input so they have ground Truth for     
52:12     
these neuron locations in this movie data they take the first frame and then     
52:17     
in subsequent frames they predict the location of each neuron we evaluate two classical models for cell tracking tests     
52:25     
ult track and 3D cell tracker detailed instructions are included in the individual folder of each tracking     
52:32     
method okay so they want to be able to allow us to uh verify different tracking     
52:39     
methods make sure that they're um you know robust so you talk about ult track for a     
52:47     
minute here the segmentation part an old track can be for perform using Watershed cell coaster Stardust types of     
52:55     
segmentation here we use stard dist with the pre-trained weights available at OSF so it's this OSF repository here     
53:03     
pre-trained and fine tuned weights can also be downloaded from Google Drive and so they give instructions on how to run     
53:10     
a pre-trained version of alt Trak and the fine tune version so that's a little bit about     
53:17     
that paper and its Associated GitHub repository um you know hopefully if     
53:22     
people are interested in Google summer of code they can check that out maybe that will help you in your Google summer     
53:28     
of code work especially in you know getting some data sets and verifying the     
53:34     
data sets and running Ben performing benchmarks that you can then     
53:41     
report okay it looks like dick had to go to another meeting so any questions about any of the papers that we talked     
53:50     
about you're muted s it's just myself so um yeah I'm     
53:57     
interested in the physical connectome um I need to get into     
54:04     
networks perhaps a little more because it relates to the 10 segres I was doing     
54:11     
and um the network nodes are kind of like     
54:16     
the nodes in Integrity I believe yeah s and as far as     
54:24     
the uh signal con ome that would depend on the connections between the dendrites     
54:33     
and the and the axons wherever they they     
54:39     
connect wouldn't it wouldn't it be like yeah so for like um a typical well you     
54:45     
know there's of course the chemical connecto which is where you have synapses between two cells where you     
54:52     
have a cell a neuron and axon and then those the synapses and roids which have     
54:58     
some form of chemical communication so you have some sort of neurotransmitter     
55:03     
or peptid there and then you have the Gap Junctions which are the electrical     
55:08     
connections which are physical between cells there's an exchange of     
55:14     
neuropeptide there sometimes or of neurotransmitter there and then     
55:19     
sometimes you have these peptidergic uh connectomes which are where peptides will leak out across like in intell     
55:27     
extracellular space and'll be taken up by neighbor neurons they may have     
55:32     
synaptic connections they may not where War grab Junction connections or you know okay that's just that i' I've heard     
55:39     
of uh I don't know dendrites connecting to the middle of an axon sometimes so     
55:47     
you get sometimes yeah yeah it's a you get that happening too I guess it's well     
55:53     
they still get Gap Junctions yeah yeah you do well well you Gap Junctions are     
55:58     
usually those connectomes are different from the chemical connectomes of synapses because yeah they're not a     
56:06     
synapse right right it's a different yeah yeah which are more     
56:11     
relevant in a heart maybe yeah yeah and then of course in non- neuronal     
56:18     
cells you have Gap Junctions and they perform communicative things and you     
56:24     
have you know peptides that diffuse or other types of signaling molecules that     
56:29     
diffuse uh in non-neuronal cells that don't you know there's no there are no synaptic connections there but they do     
56:37     
have this ability to communicate by signaling and that's of course this     
56:43     
signaling Network so you have some parallels and non neuronal cells but not the chemical connections that you find     
56:50     
in neurons and so it's there also you know you also have uh different types     
56:57     
of um ion channels in non- neuronal cells that allow for this sort of you     
57:05     
know we think of neuronal cells as having ion channels and expressing ion channels and that's what makes sort of a     
57:13     
uh the ability for chemical communication but we have this in nonoral cells as well that's a lot of Michael Lev's work on bioelectricity     
57:21     
where you have ion channels that produce electrical signals that aren't     
57:27     
um that are anything like action potentials but can per perform these     
57:33     
communicative things between cells so it's it's really a yeah there's a lot of     
57:39     
connectivity between cells depending on the cell type there are a lot of modes of uh communication and connectivity and     
57:46     
it's really I like this idea of Divergent networks because even in the     
57:52     
same group of cells you have many different types of networks but especially AC cross cells of different     
57:57     
types you have these networks that join together and key points and um they're     
58:04     
all kind of connected okay     
58:10     
yeah yeah a mechanical connection still needs to be considered oh of course yeah     
58:16     
and then of course you have your biot or your bioten segurity structures which are where they're they have this     
58:24     
mechanical connectivity that is keeping everything together yeah     
58:29     
it's sort of instantaneous as well you push one thing and it it moves     
58:36     
the other yeah okay least I can show that on my my     
58:45     
small tties I have here yeah that if you push one thing and it changes the other     
58:51     
side of the structure yeah it's kind of neat anyways     
58:58     
all right well thanks for attending oh well I look forward to it every Monday yes this starts off my week     
59:05     
so yeah all right have a good week all     
59:10     
right thank you thanks bye bye
