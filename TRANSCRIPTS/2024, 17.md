0:04          
Hi how are you okay today's a holiday I sent you sweet          
0:13          
note it's Victoria Day I totally forgot yes you're in Indiana yeah I mean when I when I          
0:21          
was when I was in Canada yeah we would have this is a h yeah yeah          
0:27          
yes we celebrate Queen Victoria yeah I mean for for us we have Memorial          
0:34          
time which um is which was last week it's next week next week          
0:40          
yeah yeah right looks like we've got dick and          
0:47          
usin Jesse rali H love rali and          
0:52          
Pocky all right okay uh R uh Radia uh take a look          
0:59          
at your email know there two other people I invited but only half an hour before okay all right yeah I'll take a          
1:06          
look they might show up they might show up next week okay yeah that' be that          
1:11          
would be fine yeah so um any updates before we get          
1:17          
into there's          
1:22          
Morgan uh yeah one of my notes uh from the stuff I did this weekend you may be          
1:29          
off the hook on peing noise oh okay well I was going to give a demo on          
1:36          
that but okay well I mean it probably be useful for other things but maybe you I need I need some          
1:42          
independent thought about it yeah I think I found a way around it okay yeah          
1:50          
well I'll show you what I have we'll see if it's useful or not and          
1:56          
okay I don't know if Hussein had anything he wanted to          
2:02          
yeah I mean so I spoke well so I've been I've already presented a few times I think everyone in this room and          
2:08          
obviously dick because it's under the project I'm working under for the breast cancer CD uh comput tomography research          
2:14          
accelerating that sort of uh that sort of work um so I mean this it's not about          
2:20          
Z work but it's um it's you know it's related to the okay may have bradle into it too yeah          
2:29          
if it's if it evolves plar noise then on some level so          
2:35          
um so I mean I've already I've already spoken about it a couple times um but I'm happy to just rate too um so overall          
2:41          
this project I've been working on z um and maybe I can share my screen so I can share like a paper too yeah go          
2:48          
ahead that' be that'd be pretty pretty helpful all right um I just need to put up the          
2:54          
paper Okay um yes so excuse          
3:03          
me uh breast excuse me breast cancer here we go and this is from my inbox          
3:11          
so paper from from Gmail okay so dick uh zck and I have been working for the past          
3:17          
couple months now on a very recent new prodject um involving um breast          
3:23          
K involving improving the efficiency of methods of breast cancer computed computed tomography excuse me          
3:30          
uh so with breast cancer research there are a lot of different approaches to um detecting or Imaging or trying to figure          
3:36          
out trying to see how well we can diagnose and detect breast cancer like mamography ultrasound MRI and um like CT          
3:43          
scans so this um this approach we we're suggesting if we're investigating is using algorithms like Mar so and          
3:50          
potentially like maybe even like some other ones e Hector and advanced inovative methods for image reconstruction for detailed and high          
3:56          
quality images from the CT scans themselves so we want to overcome typical limitations of noise of artifact          
4:03          
so the um like like the Mart algorithm for breast cancer the mar algorithm for          
4:09          
breast cancer in particular like uh what what was it like multip multiplica algebra excuse me          
4:15          
multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique similar to like from this paper that I'm showing right here          
4:23          
um like this this one I'm try because di said this one to me recently but I wanted to          
4:31          
an overview of what a typical say learning          
4:38          
or breast cancer proc this this isn't exactly what we're doing this is from this paper but um ideally we'd want to          
4:44          
investigate these methods um excuse me we' want to investigate these methods          
4:50          
um we'd want to investigate our approach to if possible          
4:57          
see where we can go go to town with this it could patent this for the startup particularly using um josph Janos speres          
5:04          
which is really cool and not not only is it like really cool h of itself it's going to be used um with uh 3D modeling          
5:12          
tools you know and speaking of which dick um I mentioned blender you know that cool art software program I told          
5:17          
you I'm trying to switch over to unreal I think unreal would actually be better than this you know so if you're from          
5:23          
unreal is another um unreal is another Graphics engine like um it's used like games um VFX          
5:31          
things like that but like basically we need to use some sort of threedimensional engine for simulating x-ray beams to interact with the like          
5:37          
the mirrors between the two hemispheres of the Janis or the Janos speres um the          
5:42          
Janos speres are not in this they're not in this one but the the geospheres themselves are B basically          
5:49          
um excuse me when we study how the electronic beams hit them the electronic          
5:56          
beams hit the mirrors between the two genos speres that is what's involved in the breast cancer detection themselves          
6:02          
like we would want to see how um okay so if I'm if I'm getting this right it's          
6:07          
the it's the Spheres themselves that um are used in detecting which tissue would be considered cancerous and which one          
6:14          
would which one not not quite the uh purpose of the          
6:19          
jaspher is to aim the x-rays we have detectors at the other          
6:25          
end through the breast yeah all right let me just take note of that          
6:30          
way yeah uh so what we're trying to do is electronically steer x-rays which is          
6:36          
quite a          
6:43          
trick we're not we're not pull tricks here this is all legitimate research yeah yes          
6:49          
it's um yeah don't be so [Laughter]          
6:57          
sure we ain't peer reviewed yet yeah this the type of slide of hand you          
7:03          
can see in statistics and science it's pretty shocking so          
7:09          
well anyways um so okay so speaking speaking of Tricks so basically the JIS          
7:15          
speres um the Gus speres uh excuse me          
7:20          
after the Roman god Jus so and he was like depicted with two faces so that's where he gets this idea of like two          
7:27          
hemispheres by these particles these spheres would be characterized by their dual functionality of two hemispheres          
7:34          
each from different materials or different types of surface properties and you can be use them you can use for multiple roles within like a single          
7:40          
application like drug delivery image processing so okay so using the genos speres to steer the xrays themselves          
7:47          
um um so typically we'd be able to model them with one side um a particular          
7:53          
material for reflecting or deflecting xrays and the other one for like something for more control like magnetic          
7:59          
response um uh let me actually see like uh like          
8:04          
you know so          
8:15          
okay not relevant but just another approach          
8:20          
so this one that di like          
8:34          
weting or intellectual property we would want to see compar yeah I'm happy to answer          
8:41          
questions happy to see what sort of discussion or things you know people like be interested in talking about moving forward um so yeah in blender you          
8:49          
can easily make spheres and things using using like the 3D art and animation software and uh but unreal I found          
8:56          
unreal is actually better for uh physics simulations okay oh yeah so like uh          
9:02          
these these these uh companies for like software engineering physics engineering that have been potentially reaching out          
9:08          
for interviews and potential positions many of them are really strongly preferring unreal it just has a lot          
9:13          
better functionality for physics simulations compar the blender so blender is decent too um blender is decent too but I think          
9:20          
un just offers a lot more so that's why yeah based in C++ so blender is          
9:26          
primarily based in P yep excuse me yeah that's great          
9:33          
um yeah any other comments on that I know that this this is something          
9:40          
that dick has been trying to figure out how to what methods to use to best do          
9:45          
this so yeah for sure and um this actually is a pretty strong introduction of some of          
9:52          
the work that other people around here are doing too for example Bradley's work on multiscale pear noise um they stop          
9:58          
say we want to see how we can integrate plar noise based on like the the uh the          
10:05          
like the anomy simulations that are already there for enhancing the realism of tissue simulation and see which ones          
10:11          
can provide Max like the best contrast for interaction with x-ray protons too          
10:16          
excuse me the the xay the X-ray phons so yeah yeah was saying uh this weekend uh          
10:22          
I I went through a whole bunch of papers on contrast enhancement and it looks like we may be          
10:29          
able to ignore pear noise all right right cool okay I'll send you a copy of that later          
10:37          
today cool cool thanks thanks okay I ordered some a copy to          
10:43          
Bradley because he was working on P Li yeah yeah yeah okay yeah that's great thank          
10:50          
you Hussein um yeah so let's see I'll let me          
10:55          
get into a few more things few things before I get into the I was going to show the stuff I've been doing in pear          
11:01          
and noise I have a demo uh but I'm going to show a few things before that so this          
11:07          
week is um I guess our final week before the end of the community period and and          
11:14          
Google summer of code so we have Google summer of code we have our community period it's about three weeks where you          
11:21          
know we try to get familiar with our community and so that's you know it's a way to kind of figure out you know set          
11:29          
up what you're doing but also to make connections with people in the broader          
11:35          
community in our community we have d uh dorm and we have the dorm group and we          
11:41          
have our website and our YouTube channel and our GitHub repositories and all that we have our meetings and then we have          
11:48          
we're also affiliated with the open room foundation so the open room Foundation          
11:53          
is uh you know what we're organized under and um hcky and mahul have been          
12:01          
attending uh our open source meetings through the orthogonal lab which is          
12:06          
another thing that we're affiliated with but uh I want today I want to talk a little bit about openworm to make sure          
12:13          
that we as a group are sort of um on top of that in terms of the community so I'm          
12:20          
just going to go over the openworm website which is I guess          
12:28          
somewhat out of date uh it could always be updated kind of rely on people to make uh pull requests to the website to          
12:34          
update it but uh you know they're different so they're different first of all open or is organized into a number          
12:42          
of different projects um it's a foundation it's a 501c3 so they have you          
12:49          
know that sort of structure they had it's just a collective of different projects so you know we have various          
12:56          
things available to people like the open room browser which is modeling celegans in 3D so you can build 3D models of the          
13:04          
worm you can build models of the muscles and you can build models of the neurons          
13:09          
and the and the cells and the body wall and that that's a static model that you          
13:15          
could rotate and cut apart and and look inside but we also have other types of          
13:20          
models that model the physiology and the cell biology more specifically so we          
13:27          
have the openworm browser which is a a nice intro to uh the worm and that's          
13:33          
something that's been uh maintained in blender there's a master blender file          
13:38          
that has been maintained uh for you know the duration of the openworm          
13:47          
Endeavor so we have but we have other models as well so we have the neuroml          
13:53          
connecto and this is a model of the connectome or all the neurons of seans          
13:59          
s cake yeah so this is 302 neurons uh with their connections here          
14:06          
and you have you know the idea is to model each one of those each con set of          
14:12          
connections and you're able to explore the connectome in different ways so one of the reasons that celegans is          
14:18          
interesting is because we have this relatively small connectome with the uh          
14:24          
you know we have a tractable number of neurons we have a tractable number of connections and we can actually model          
14:30          
that and different you know behaviors like movement behaviors or whatever so          
14:35          
we have you know these kind of tools like connectome modeling we have          
14:40          
visualization and simulation platforms like jepetto that's another thing that's being worked on this allows you to do          
14:48          
different types of simulations in neuroml and so you could uh play with          
14:54          
those uh let's see if we have any other projects off of this okay cybernetic          
14:59          
which is the biophysics uh model of the worm so this is where we have a simulated worm and          
15:06          
instead of having a 3D model of different parts of the anatomy we have this worm that has a physics and it's uh          
15:14          
moving through a physical medium so it could be moving through a gel or it could be moving through soil and the          
15:21          
idea of cybernetic is you model all the param physical parameters of those interactions between the worm's body and          
15:28          
the the surface and so you know you have these kind of biophysics models you can also model          
15:34          
parts of the muscle parts of the soft tissue the soft tissues are these compliant you know it's a compliant          
15:41          
material that has a you know a variable stiffness and depending on the medium          
15:47          
you know it can it you know there can be some interactions there that are interesting and effect movement so you          
15:54          
generate movement from the from the ner uh from the connecto but there's also          
15:59          
feedback from this physical environment so we can model those things um there's worm Sim so that's          
16:07          
another type of mechanical model and it's focused on muscle models and things          
16:13          
like that so we can take these muscles that we saw in the 3D model and we can model their Dynamics uh we can model the          
16:21          
hoden Huxley dynamics of muscle and so forth so we can do a lot of things here          
16:26          
in the um in we you also use smooth particle          
16:31          
hydrodynamics to model some of these things as well uh then there's of course          
16:38          
storm and you know so there are a number of projects and you can go to the website at openworm dorg you can explore          
16:45          
some of these things uh we have different databases like the movement database we have different data sets          
16:51          
that I talked about last week and of course if you go into the uh slack          
16:57          
explore the channels and see what's going on um it there isn't a huge amount of activity but because you know we have          
17:05          
the paid version of slack for this we can go back into the archives and look at some of the things that people have          
17:11          
posted on some of these projects and if you go to the uh GitHub          
17:16          
repository uh you'll see that there's uh a fair amount of activity so this is you          
17:22          
know there's a link directly to the GitHub repository here and this is of course          
17:28          
where you can do things you can contribute to open or proper because a lot of the uh GitHub uh infrastructure          
17:36          
I've shown in the meeting is Diva worm related but this is the openworm uh GitHub and and so uh you          
17:43          
know I don't know how many people are really familiar with what's here but there are a lot of so there's a lot of          
17:49          
the projects are here c302 which is one of the connecto models uh jepetto is          
17:56          
here Channel worm which is involves uh uh ion channels and modeling ion          
18:02          
channels here uh we have other repositories for different papers so          
18:08          
there are some standard biophysical models in the literature that are relevant to celegans and what's been          
18:15          
done is that we have these repositories that are created um these model DB          
18:22          
repositories and you know you can can you can look at those and maybe even contribute or make a fork of your own          
18:29          
uh we have uh this main openworm repository which is where you can find a          
18:35          
Docker file and that Docker file if you install it on your local machine allows          
18:41          
you to run a simulation that kind of goes through all of the models so it's a summary of the          
18:47          
models and it's kind of a it's a tough thing to get running but you know if you run it it's it's really nice nice          
18:54          
demonstration of what the uh Foundation is all about um then there's some          
19:00          
repositories for some of the side projects there's nothing here for dorm because we're kind of separate from this          
19:07          
uh GitHub repository and so you know there are all sorts of resources here there's a fork          
19:13          
of the worm neuro Atlas and and some other things so that's a lot of the stuff that's          
19:19          
involved in the community of openworm there's also of course the slack and of course the website which          
19:25          
has uh some links to documentation and like I said it's a little dated but          
19:31          
you know it's it's something that has I think most of the relevant          
19:36          
information uh we have like papers and and there's a science link that links to          
19:43          
you know the list of papers and some documentation so um that's that's the          
19:50          
openworm foundation yeah so we had a diva worm about a decade ago we've been kind of          
19:56          
going separately from the main openworm uh          
20:02          
apparatus oh although we know we we're still part of what they do um so yeah so          
20:10          
definitely check that out if you're interested in um you know that          
20:15          
Community um so yeah Community period will be wrapping up at the end of probably at the end of this week and          
20:21          
beginning of next week next week of course is the uh in the United States          
20:28          
it's more mem morial day so we may or may not have a meeting it's hard to say          
20:33          
um but then you know we'll get into the coding period uh you know at the end towards          
20:39          
the end of May so actually for Pocky and mahul you know I expect you to be working kind of right now on getting set          
20:47          
up getting everything ready and I think you have been doing that and you know kind of working through some of the          
20:54          
things that you're going to be doing for your coding period And I know Haman isues here and and Jess are here so as          
21:01          
mentors you know we want to be able to help people I don't know if you know you          
21:06          
need to help them with the coding part but you know we're going to be facilitating our meetings and we'll have          
21:13          
the open source meetings on Fridays and we'll have these meetings on Mondays so uh try to attend at least one of those          
21:20          
but you know preferably both because I think the the open source meetings are valuable and then these meetings are          
21:27          
valuable for kind of understanding what's going on in the project and you know we'll give          
21:33          
updates and we'll see you know we'll do this weekly and we'll see what kind of problems arise and we'll see what kind          
21:40          
of progress is made and then we'll kind of constantly re-evaluate over the summer where we are so we want to verily          
21:47          
keep on top of that so that we don't have any major problems that arise because sometimes that can happen if you          
21:54          
fall out of communication or you just kind of ignore small problems so we want          
21:59          
to we don't want to have that happen also for Pocky and mahul we have          
22:06          
uh this is the place where I want you to contribute I've invited both of you via          
22:12          
email to daph or to the dvo learn um organization          
22:18          
so dvol learn is this organization github.com Devo learn and it has uh the          
22:25          
dvo learn main Repository some of the cell models like we have cell Sam          
22:31          
segment anything we have the nucleus segmenter we have model anotation we          
22:37          
have a number of other models here so basically these models nuclear segmentor membrane segmentor and lineage          
22:45          
population these are the same things that you'd find on hugging face the cell          
22:50          
segment anything model is something that uh sush mon was working on last year          
22:56          
that's a fork of the mment anything model from meta um and then we have some other          
23:03          
things and then that's all kind of the Devo learn project or the D.A learn platform D graph of course is the          
23:09          
repository you'll be contributing to and that's here so we have a number of contributors that have already been a          
23:16          
part of this but I've invited you to dvo learn is the organization that'll give          
23:22          
you permissions to Devo graph if you accept that um app that that invitation          
23:28          
you'll be able to push to Devo graph and manage issues which we will manage on a          
23:34          
project board which uh I don't know if I've set it up on this          
23:41          
one may have to go to the main okay so I I I don't think I've set          
23:48          
it up yet but I'm going to set up a project board in dor graph where it's          
23:53          
actually managed at the you know the uh organizational level but we'll have that          
24:00          
project word ready to go and it'll just be something we'll review um and see you know if you have          
24:07          
issues please post those issues and then we can put them in a in a can band board so we can move them across from um you          
24:15          
know to do to completion and you know that'd be a good way to manage some of these issues          
24:21          
especially the ones that are collabor where you know we're all kind of working on different part different things          
24:28          
things that kind of overlap so if um there's a common resource that's needed          
24:34          
or there's something that might be of interest to someone else that would be a good place to put it on the project          
24:39          
board and so you know it for the repository I kind of want people to to          
24:44          
push regularly to that because it's important that we keep everything off of          
24:50          
our local machines and the reason for that is that you know you don't want it crashing and losing all your work you          
24:57          
want to have everything kind of push to GitHub push to an open source place          
25:03          
where a we can evaluate it and B it's not you know it's backed up and we can          
25:11          
we don't lose anything so that and also it kind of reinforces workflows because you know          
25:18          
what's important here isn't just that you generate a bunch of code it's that you kind of sculpt a workflow so that we          
25:25          
can later write documentation for it we can go back to it and see what the logic          
25:30          
of something is you know how something was arrived at and what everything you know what all is there so it's very          
25:39          
important yeah so any questions about          
25:47          
that yeah all right um so yeah so let's see          
25:55          
uh next I'm going to talk about something that um so my KN Deb was one          
26:02          
of our gach um students in a couple years ago and he really worked on          
26:09          
driving forward the devil learn stuff and he's you know em and Miner or him          
26:16          
and myre brothers and they they kind of came in one year after the other so they          
26:21          
were they're both very uh key to uh developing Deva earn as it stands now          
26:28          
well you know they're they keep in touch in the organization so after gso they keep in touch and Mino just sent me this          
26:36          
uh this uh paper and this uh Associated pip PE repository on cells 3D so this is          
26:46          
on self-supervised 3D cell segmentation for microscopy so this is a new thing that          
26:52          
came out um recently I guess this is something that is uh there's a platform          
26:57          
called napari or a set of tools called napari and this is um uh it's it's a          
27:04          
python package it plugs into nari so this is cells 3D so a lot of times in um          
27:10          
when people are working with microscopy data uh they need to have a number of          
27:16          
tools but one of the key tools for this is cell segmentation and so as doing your D          
27:23          
graph work uh step one will be kind of work with what we have in terms of s          
27:30          
segmentation and applying that to your problem so you have to have a good starting point with input data with          
27:36          
getting the input data getting the features out of it and then moving forward and and you know uh when we did          
27:43          
this when we did D graph projects in the past we always had people working on          
27:49          
Cell segmentation as part of their project but this year I think it'll be we have enough infrastructure locally in          
27:58          
Diva learn to sort of skip that step and just apply what's there so we'll see how          
28:03          
that goes but in any case this is a new uh package called cell sake          
28:10          
3D and this is uh from this group here group of          
28:15          
authors uh and let let's go over the abstract and then go look at the pipe          
28:21          
repository so the abstract for this is understanding the complex threedimensional structure of cells is          
28:27          
crucial across Ross many disciplines of biology and especially Neuroscience so this is focused on neurons and          
28:34          
segmenting neuronal cells and of course those are very different from developmental cells in the sense that          
28:40          
they have different morphologies and they're you know embedded in a different type of phenotype or different I mean you know          
28:47          
you're probably here you're doing Mamon nervous systems or you know those are          
28:53          
much more complex than something like what we'd see with C elegant here we introduce novel 3D          
28:58          
self-supervised learning method designed to address the inherent complexity of quantifying cells in 3D volumes so again          
29:06          
you know we have these three-dimensional volumes we have these two-dimensional images that are in a stack usually so          
29:13          
you have a stack from one uh along one uh morphological or phen or anatomical          
29:23          
orientation and then you go from like maybe from uh top to          
29:29          
bottom and you get these you know you get different set parts of the tissue in in those Vol in those uh snapshots and          
29:37          
then you reconstruct the volume from that so there's a lot of complexity in          
29:43          
in these 3D volumes and what they'll do uh in preparing the specimen is they'll          
29:48          
clear the tissue try to get a lot of the uh extraneous proteins and extracellular          
29:54          
or Matrix out so you get a clear snapshot of the cells and so then they          
30:00          
do this they do this they do sectioning and then they take these images and you get this data uh so we offer a new 3D          
30:08          
mesos spim data set so this is a technique called mesos spim uh spim is a type of microscopy          
30:15          
that yields pretty high resolution images that usually we don't have or not          
30:21          
associated with a fluorescent signal it's just like a image usually like          
30:27          
black and white and you know it's very high resolution we have some spim images          
30:33          
of uh seans in our D zo so but this is a technique that you can use to really          
30:39          
kind of get a handle on the cells and the cell bodies um and so we offer a new          
30:45          
mesos spam data set and so they actually have a data set associated with this as well and show that cell seg 3D can match          
30:53          
state-of-the supervised methods so this is something that where you know these          
30:58          
state-of-the-art methods and you want to be able to match them and this platform          
31:04          
does that our contributions are made accessible through a python package which we'll talk about in a minute with          
31:10          
full gu or graphical user interface integration in nari so if you're using nari the platform this is basically a          
31:18          
plugin yeah so there's a data set associated with this um you know this is just going to this pre-print uh finding          
31:26          
I I I guess it's in their supplemental materials so this is the uh the PIP PE          
31:31          
repository for um cells 3D this is associated with the Pary so this kind of          
31:37          
gives you an idea of what kinds of things that they're doing here so this          
31:43          
is uh the logo that they have here and then this is if I can zoom in on          
31:50          
this this is sort of an image of what you see so you're working with this three-dimensional          
31:56          
volume and and it's there are these different volumes here and they all have          
32:02          
you know cells segmented in those volumes and then you're able to work with them so you install this there's          
32:08          
documentation here uh this is from the Adaptive motor control          
32:14          
lab and this kind of deals you know this kind of talks about the details of the          
32:20          
software so this looks like an interesting um          
32:25          
approach let me look at the document maybe that has the data set in          
32:31          
it okay so now you can see up here this 3D Volume you can zoom in this is a          
32:38          
human brain you're able to take a volume of the human          
32:44          
brain you're able to take a volume of that human brain and focus in on it so          
32:49          
you have an atlas that you can match up things too so that's good stuff I don't know          
32:56          
um you know I don't know how relevant that is to what we're doing this summer but you know these are the kinds of          
33:02          
tools that you can use um you know that this is sort of the stateof the-art so I          
33:08          
think being familiar with the stateof the art in these areas is good because you know kind of what people are trying          
33:14          
to do or want to do and then incorporate uh those          
33:20          
features so you can see that like this e exercise of cell segmentation is not          
33:27          
just the simple was plug throwing data at an algorithm there's a lot of stuff you need to think about in terms of the          
33:34          
data set you select and then also the sort of the techniques that go into          
33:39          
preprocessing as well as linking the segmented data to some Atlas or some          
33:46          
other thing so you know there's and then of course in our case we're taking segmented data and then we're doing          
33:52          
other things with it and so that's another uh workflow you need to plug into          
34:01          
okay so that's enough on on the stuff uh from my knock I thank you my knock for          
34:07          
sharing that now I'll get into this Pearl and noise uh demo because we've been talking          
34:14          
about this for a while and I I've I've been having some problems finding the right code for this there are some          
34:20          
toolboxes and there is a lot of deprecation that happened with some of the toolboxes available this is there's          
34:27          
a toolbox in Python called pear and noise so you can install Pearl and noise          
34:33          
and work with it and you know this is a toolbox that's freely available so what          
34:39          
I'm have here now is a collab notebook and I've installed pear of noise I've          
34:45          
got a matap plot lib I'm going to be generating some plots and then um so          
34:50          
that's all set up pear noise 1.12 uh and the so the first thing I'm          
34:55          
going to do is I'm going to run this Pearl and noise function and I'm in it          
35:01          
uh there two variables here there's octaves and Seed so octaves is in pein          
35:07          
noise so a pearlin noise is it's the specific type of noise that was generated by a computer scientist named          
35:15          
Ken pearlin and he developed this as a procedural generation tool so you have          
35:21          
what you know as gausia noise which is uh if you've ever seen television static          
35:27          
that's what that is it's it's like you can have an even field and we'll see that in a bit but that's what gausian          
35:33          
noise is it's basically this uh uniform noise and you know it's it's a cross you          
35:41          
can have a two-dimensional plot of it Pearla noise is different Pearla noise has sort of a periodicity to it and it          
35:48          
has this pattern so you can see here in this plot in in green you have this sort          
35:54          
of looks like maybe it's a pattern but it's it's sort of uh uh blurry and so          
36:02          
that's it's generating this sort of um I mean it doesn't look like static it          
36:09          
looks like it has some maybe even some pattern underneath but it's you know it maybe it looks like blobs if you've ever          
36:16          
seen um uh bubble te where they have these balls in the bottom and that's          
36:22          
what it kind of looks like but um so it has this these different Bobs and then          
36:28          
if you increase the number of octaves you actually get something that looks more like it becomes as you increase the          
36:36          
number of octaves it looks increasingly more like gsy and noise so this is one          
36:42          
of the parameters octaves so you can set your octaves high or low and it gives you different sort of you know patterns          
36:49          
in this noise and then the random seed of course is just a number that you plug in and I don't know if there any like          
36:58          
tendencies in the seed usually not it's usually a random seed but you want to you know if you vary that it varies the          
37:05          
pattern in some way so what I'm going to do here is generate a 100 by 100 pixel          
37:11          
array I'm going to generate Pearl and noise using this toolbox using this function Pearl and noise I'm going to do          
37:19          
this for an octaves value of four and then I'm going to generate this pick          
37:25          
variable I'm going to plug that in into this uh IM show I'm going to color green          
37:32          
and there you are that's the first image so you have this pearing noise it's in green you have what looks like these          
37:39          
dark blobs underneath you have these lighter areas and it's very blurry and          
37:44          
the idea is that you have these octaves which are these like I guess this periodicity within the field of noise          
37:51          
and so it's very different from that uniform static so that's what it looks like using this python          
37:59          
tool now we have this uh so basically I'm going to do some checks here the          
38:06          
noise is at a value of 0.5 so this is basically you know I could probably bias          
38:11          
if I wanted to go into the function I could bias the noise in some way uh I          
38:16          
could also do some sort of uh you know it's not limited in terms of spatial          
38:21          
Dimension it's uh seamless for any size so if I increase this array by and I'm          
38:28          
going to do this later by fivefold it's going to give me similar a similar          
38:33          
pattern you know so it's it's not going to repeat it's just going to kind of be the same pattern but it's going to be          
38:39          
bigger so that's basically what's going to happen here so this next step is where I do uh          
38:47          
a a pearlin noise plot with a higher number a higher octave value which is 25          
38:53          
so this is actually uh let's see uh almost five a little bit more than          
38:58          
fivefold greater octaves so this is going to show how if you increase the octaves parameter you know it looks more          
39:07          
it looks different than the first image it doesn't actually necessarily look like uniform static but it looks          
39:13          
actually more uniform here you'll see this plot in green so again I'm plotting 100 by 100 pixels and we have this image          
39:21          
in green where you have it almost looks like a a shag carpet where it's got like this pattern it's not you know it's          
39:29          
highly periodic but it's not uh it's well it's it's uniform I guess it's          
39:34          
periodic in some way but you you can still see it looks different than like a          
39:41          
a static uh gausian noise so this is interesting you this is just generating          
39:48          
this um it's just procedural generation and you're just changing one parameter          
39:53          
here of course I'm changing the seed but I don't think that matters so much um so this is what we get          
40:00          
here so now I can also do this for a one-dimensional array I can plot this in a          
40:05          
one-dimensional u stretch so you know this is 100 by 100 you can plot this for          
40:11          
a single one dimensional array of plar noise and now this why this might be          
40:16          
relevant is that you can also generate onedimensional cellular autometer and I          
40:22          
was thinking about this when I was doing these experiments I was thinking about cellular autometa and like like I was          
40:27          
thinking about this onedimensional case of cellular automa where you have this like long uh basically it's          
40:36          
a a single vector and you know you you have this one-dimensional Sol autometa          
40:43          
where you know you're you have two neighbors a neighborhood of two cells on either side of you and you can get some          
40:50          
interesting patterns and then you put those together and you can get the kinds of things we see from the uh wol from          
40:57          
books and things like that so I was thinking about this because in cellular autometa you have certain rules and you          
41:05          
have these cells that change their state over time and with pear and noise it's generative as well where you have this          
41:11          
gener this procedural noise that you can uh you know up you know get a sort of a          
41:17          
end State and so what I'm thinking is that there might be some connection between pear noise and one-dimensional          
41:23          
cellular autometer but that's that's something for a different time I don't have a demo for          
41:29          
that in any case you know so this is the code for the one-dimensional um pearlin noise array          
41:37          
um this is actually where we have uh our random array so this is actually random          
41:43          
noise here this is not pearlin noise and this is now in glue so this is where I'm          
41:49          
generating a random array of 100 by 100 pixels and I'm plotting it blue and you          
41:55          
can see that it looks like this uniform form static this is what if you watch an analog television and the station is off          
42:02          
the air this is what it looks like and it has a static field and you know it          
42:07          
just kind of uh there's no no periodicity here no pattern but it's          
42:13          
actually useful as a mask so you can mask things and people often have done this where they mask it with this          
42:20          
uniform noise and you know an image you can embed an image underneath that noise and you can increase the noise you know          
42:27          
a certain and we're going to we're going to see that later and so you know this is a very useful tool but we can also          
42:34          
use the pear and noise as a mask and we're going to see how those two things vary in a little bit so that's random          
42:41          
noise and then this is uh comparison of random noise and pear noise back to back          
42:47          
so this is where we have this random noise but in green and then we have the pearlin noise underneath and so you know          
42:54          
these are two different types of noise so by sides you can see the differences in how they look um this almost looks          
43:02          
like a an artificial turf type thing and this looks very different this almost          
43:07          
looks like maybe a set of bacterial colonies if you squint closely enough but the point is is that they're          
43:13          
different so we have this now I'm plotting things in red here this is our random but this what we're doing here is          
43:20          
we're doing some experiments in combining pearlin noise and uh gy noise          
43:28          
so you know we can see that there differences here but what happens if we combine the two what happens if we          
43:34          
overlay the two instead of putting them side by side and so you see here is the first example is where we have this          
43:40          
additive combination of pearlin noise and uh dowy and noise and so we have          
43:47          
this uh I've just done an additive version here where we have additive noise and it looks different than the          
43:53          
the pearlin noise um it it's you know it's not it doesn't look like either one          
43:59          
but it looks maybe closer to prolin noise so this is what it looks like here          
44:04          
and then the second example is where I have a multiplicative example so it's          
44:10          
just the difference between taking these two arrays and adding their values together and taking these two rays and          
44:16          
multiplying the values together and so the multiplicative case actually looks quite a bit different than the additive          
44:22          
case you can see in the multiplicative case you almost get this like enhanced per noise it almost looks like it's just          
44:29          
kind of like got a weird mask on it and so you have these sort of uh you know          
44:36          
you can see kind of the high octave pearlin noise with sort of this mask of          
44:41          
noise gy noise over it anyway it looks interesting so that's interesting from          
44:48          
the standpoint of different types of noise and what you might be able to do with pearlin noise um but what I want to          
44:53          
do now is I want to look at like what happens if you mask an image into the OR you mask it with pear noise          
45:00          
you mask it with a grading of bars and you mask it with uh Gan noise so I'm          
45:06          
going to use Mario here as an example of an image it's very colorful has a white          
45:11          
background and we're going to take Mario we're going to mask him with different types of noise so here's Mario and we          
45:18          
have our pearlin noise we have octave value of 72 so it's very high octave          
45:24          
pear noise and we're generating the the Pearl and noise here in green you can          
45:29          
see that this is even higher in terms of the octaves than even our the high          
45:35          
octave uh example that we had in the last set of examples so this is where you actually see some almost like some          
45:42          
striping underneath you know you're starting to get some real you know periodicity here and some consequences          
45:49          
of that so this is the mask that we're going to use and so we take this mask and we take Mario and we place them over          
45:57          
another now the way to do this is you can actually do this using plot IM show          
46:02          
from Matt plot lib so you can use Matt plot lib is the tool you can actually take Mario as the underlying image you          
46:10          
can then use the noise as a mask and you can actually use in different colors so you can do the cmap uh function you can          
46:18          
use like different colors to do this so you can play around with this but the point is is this Alpha parameter so this          
46:25          
Alpha parameter is sort of the transparency or it's the intensity of the noise mask so this is a high alpha          
46:34          
mask so this is where it's almost one so one is like the maximum amount of noise          
46:40          
0.0 is the minimum amount of noise guess you shut it off them but you can see          
46:46          
that Mario is pretty well masked but you can still see the underling pattern so this is this high octave um pearing          
46:54          
noise masking Mario and you can see Mario but you can't see you know you you          
46:59          
can't see the detail you can only see the outline uh now we're going to take random noise so we're going to take a          
47:05          
random mask uh in green and you can see it looks very staticky and uniform and          
47:12          
we're going to mask Mario with that so now you can see Mario again uh with the          
47:17          
same Alpha value but you can see that it looks you know it's more detectable than          
47:22          
you can see with the pear noise so the pear noise is actually obscuring the on drawing image more than in this case          
47:29          
because in this case at least to my eye you can see like the details of Mario's          
47:35          
outfit and so forth so this is you know just different types of noise and how          
47:40          
they behave when you're trying to mask them at the same Alpha value uh so that's those are those examples and then          
47:46          
now I'm going to take some pear noise some very low octave pear noise an octive value of four and I'm going to go          
47:53          
back to that so this is the first example I showed but I'm going to plot that and notice that you know we have          
48:00          
this this it's a different type of pattern almost it has these blobs and it's very blurry looking and so then          
48:06          
we're going to take Mario we're going to mask Mario with this noise at the same Alpha value and we now have Mario masked          
48:13          
and it looks weird because we have this jet map instead of the green but you know it's just to to accentuate sort of          
48:21          
the the mask and so we can see that there are these blobs that are different colors so actual at this frequency it          
48:28          
doesn't mask all that much of Mario except that the blobs actually mask quite a bit so it's very um it's          
48:36          
nonuniform in terms of how it's it's masking Mario's image so that's very          
48:42          
interesting stuff um then we have uh this now I want to get into this          
48:49          
grading so you know a lot of times in perceptual studies they'll use these bar gradings and they'll have people like          
48:56          
look at them and see if they can find patterns behind them or sometimes they'll try to detect the bars so what          
49:02          
I've done here is I've created a bar plot where it's you know very very dense          
49:08          
so each one of uh for each value on the x-axis there's a bar and so there's so          
49:14          
many bars here you can't really make out the bars          
49:20          
there if you really squint you can kind of see there's this These Bars but you          
49:25          
can't really f T and and that's actually what we want we want this very dense packing of bars this dense grading so          
49:32          
what I'm going to do with this dense grading is use it as a mask but this time against the Pearl and noise so I          
49:38          
can see what will mask the Pearl and noise and so now I've used this low density uh this low octave pear and          
49:46          
noise and I mask it with this high density bar grading and so you can see          
49:52          
that the bar grading covers up the Paro and noise not to the extent that I can't see the underlying pattern but it kind          
49:59          
of covers up sort of the it it tints the uh color uh map here so you know it's          
50:06          
interesting how these things interact um so that's all I have I'm just you know I'm playing around with          
50:12          
pear one noise I'm getting some interesting results and you know if we don't use it for Imaging we can use it          
50:18          
for a lot of other things I'd like to play around with that some more and see where that goes          
50:27          
so let's see uh okay so I have some things here          
50:32          
um yeah who dicks a this is a message forine Diva worm has expanded to many          
50:39          
other organisms yeah so I think last week I talked about it but especially in          
50:44          
this 10 years of dvo uh 10 years of Diva worm presentation that's on our YouTube          
50:49          
channel I have a slide on all the different organisms that we have that we've worked on so we've worked at I not          
50:56          
noticed in doing this inventory of our different organisms we've done like eight different organisms that we've          
51:03          
kind of worked on datawise we talked about a lot more and then we've also talked about digital organisms which are          
51:10          
kind of a ninth class of organisms so we we do a lot of comparative work we talk          
51:16          
about a lot of different types of organisms uh Morgan uh says I dropped Lo          
51:22          
ryer napari chat GPT plugin and YouTube presentation in not slack so yeah this          
51:28          
is uh Lo Royer does some stuff with this sari um yeah and then the chat GPT          
51:34          
plugin which of course is obligatory now um and then there's a YouTube presentation so that's in the openworm          
51:41          
slack it's very interesting I know Morgan I don't know if he has anything to say about that if he's familiar with          
51:48          
uh the Pari tools I mean I saw his I saw his          
51:53          
presentation at the advanced microscopy Workshop the Berkeley um and you know it          
52:00          
was it was it was pretty impressive as kind of          
52:05          
a real time code Generation Um you know yeah like on the- fly image          
52:14          
filtering and yeah just yeah it was it was pretty cool um anyway but yes now it          
52:23          
is H standards that you have chat GPT and something so yeah but he he did he          
52:31          
he he showed off and and I dropped a link to his um janelia code review of it          
52:37          
like it was also just kind of interesting to see his process yeah yeah I think that'd be great even          
52:45          
though it's not really like what we do here I think there are a lot of interesting things with imaging and um          
52:52          
you know just neuroimaging but also like uh CT and other types of Imaging as well          
52:59          
yeah yeah and that was that was an interesting presentation on that that kind of noise I I wasn't familiar yeah          
53:06          
but it reminded me of of yeah various ging random field you know smooth          
53:14          
maps and those are really big those are really big in a spatial Computing right now yeah          
53:21          
yeah Bradley are you familiar with ising lates yeah          
53:27          
yeah okay uh uh a one-dimensional is ofus has an enormous number of models          
53:36          
for yeah and if you look at that versus time it will possibly generate pattern          
53:42          
similar to the uh uh in some way similar to what you were doing there with the uh          
53:47          
with the noise noise uh well it might be worth looking into as far as I can tell          
53:54          
nobody has ever done it uh though I found 800 papers on onedimensional icing          
54:01          
laes great okay so it might be fun doing uh e          
54:09          
and the different models for and lates have all sorts of interactions between          
54:15          
the yeah the theing models excuse me the          
54:20          
theing L the ising L say and the model some I uh I always used to find when I          
54:28          
especially when I was studing like physics and like um you know like computation applications of physics in various areas um I found their problems          
54:35          
uh related some problem to genery like like which which which stages are at which you can state with their          
54:41          
degenerate I found that those were um those were pretty pretty damn interesting you know from a 3D spatial          
54:47          
perspective like when involved in spatial Computing so those are those are pretty pretty cool um back to but also          
54:55          
back to what Mor was just workan was just talking about um like like gosh and gosh and splatting and um you were          
55:02          
talking about that right like gosh and splatting and um that stuff is um that's really really really big          
55:10          
um that that stuff is really really big not just from a research point of view but from the current software          
55:16          
technologies that are involved in 3D imaging so like even like you know augmented reality applications they're          
55:21          
all they're all absolutely discussing that when generating images when being able to like scan like scan my face          
55:26          
and create a deep think of me yeah yeah so um Microsoft just released one of          
55:32          
their their their abilities to do that from a single image take someone's image and you can make that person say          
55:38          
whatever the hell they want and create a video of it yeah and like it can also like kind of          
55:44          
deduce like a voice or you can you can give it a sample voice too um but          
55:49          
anyways yeah like go gosh and splatting in the in the um in the application of image processing um when the machine          
55:55          
learning and neural networks that are involved in that capability that's where it's all really really really picking up          
56:00          
the ISAC models and ISAC lates too um yeah that's really really cool too so we'd like to          
56:07          
see like to definitely see where things go so yeah yeah the idea here is an iing          
56:14          
lattice changes over time if you have a ond iing lattice you can make it two- dimensional by making          
56:20          
time the other dimension and then you get a pattern and          
56:25          
these pattern may or may not be related to the wol patterns yeah so I think it's          
56:34          
exploring yeah yeah I mean yeah like wolm has like          
56:39          
these rules that he classified and you know there might be rules that are kind          
56:44          
of in these patterns like you know because it's it's not          
56:50          
yeah it's not like you know I mean I know it's like random well it's procedurally generated so it's sort of          
56:56          
at random but it's quasi random in the sense that it has some structure to it I guess yeah so yeah and the plin noise          
57:05          
has some structure to it too right so uh it'll be interesting to take your ond          
57:11          
plin noise and well I guess the PE noise is kind of static you generate a picture          
57:18          
and that's it yeah well it's yeah procedurally generated but it doesn't have like time steps yeah it doesn't          
57:24          
have time steps whereas the in lates have time steps the time steps can be the          
57:30          
y-coordinate oh yeah and therefore generate a          
57:37          
picture yeah tried tried to bring that up at a remote uh eising lattice meeting and          
57:46          
nobody's team can understand it oh          
57:51          
well so yeah I always say unfortunately you know          
57:57          
if no one understands it perhaps you could try explaining it differently you know yeah I          
58:04          
know yeah yeah yeah one of time it's it's it's difficult oh if you mean they          
58:09          
can't understand it from their own like lock of background then not that is different but like um you know a          
58:15          
two-dimensional there's a big difference between a one and a two-dimensional iing          
58:20          
lce you know that from your physics of course of course standard ising you know          
58:28          
eing himself invented this as a one-dimensional model for uh ferromagnetism and it didn't work and          
58:36          
then other people made it two-dimensional and all of a sudden they were getting real phase          
58:42          
Transitions okay now there's a huge literature even on 1D uh ising lates and uh Direction rules          
58:52          
yeah the um I mean like and even then like the um          
58:57          
excuse me from a Computing from a Computing perspective it's all pretty straightforward like as soon as you understand the mathod you can show that it's verified the theoretical point of          
59:04          
view you can just code it as you need to like python or Julia or r or something s there so um that's there and uh I guess          
59:11          
I guess from a more theoretical perspective it's like also in some Way's understanding I like to really know like          
59:17          
is it um how valid are the constructive groups like can you really show degeneracy can you really show the          
59:22          
patterns themselves follow from those rules as established and under what conditions and how well do they really          
59:28          
generalize to the general nature of Isaac lison themselves by the well real          
59:34          
quickly just wanted to show this is what the Roman god Janice looks oh okay yeah          
59:39          
like so I was          
59:54          
talking with chemical properties one on one on the          
59:59          
other so do not ordinarily give phase          
1:00:05          
transitions but if they had an infinite uh uh range for the          
1:00:11          
interactions between particles they would do that you can get almost the          
1:00:16          
equivalent to that by taking the one-dimensional ising atus and turning it into a          
1:00:22          
circle and then each particle can interact with itself oh          
1:00:29          
yeah okay it's um it's it's yeah it's um you call either a self referential          
1:00:35          
interaction like a you know yeah it would it would be it its own system like that the particle yeah okay now uh          
1:00:43          
curiously I used this as a model for uh the shapes of uh uh cells called          
1:00:51          
ARA okay and these are often in polygonal shapes and it was able to show          
1:00:57          
that you get polygal shapes by doing that so in other words the circle          
1:01:04          
transforms into a polygon yeah and you can actually you          
1:01:10          
can actually model this physically if you have a bunch of little magnets and put them in a          
1:01:16          
ring yeah and they will snap into polygons yeah          
1:01:24          
yeah so uh it it seems like a plausible          
1:01:31          
model yeah like um you know it's a those Transformations and they um they're          
1:01:37          
essential too so yeah yeah so yeah sorry okay Bradley I have to get          
1:01:45          
to another meeting it's called coffee oh yeah all right well thank you for          
1:01:51          
attending and uh see everyone next week thank you okay thanks a lot bye          
1:01:56          
bye thank you bye thank you bye all right now I'd like to talk about swarm          
1:02:03          
lators and this is a physics tool that allows us to look at swarming          
1:02:08          
behaviors in a multitude of different contexts different types of organisms          
1:02:15          
different Collective Behavioral Systems and so forth so we'll cover a couple of key          
1:02:21          
papers go revisit some of the things we've talked about in previous meetings we've talked about swarm lators in a          
1:02:28          
number of different meetings in the past the first is a feature that we did on          
1:02:33          
chemical flows and swarms and this was back in March 6th of          
1:02:38          
2023 so we talked about Jeff's micro swimmers and flows we talked about          
1:02:44          
swarmers as a concept and we talked about swimmer uh organisms that exhibit          
1:02:50          
chemo sensation so the Swarm lator paper was this paper here          
1:02:56          
uh diverse behaviors in non-uniform chyro and non- Cyro swarm lators the          
1:03:01          
Jeff micro swimmers are these uh this is where we use jeffy's          
1:03:07          
equations to model the orientation dynamics of an asymmetric object flow at          
1:03:14          
low reyolds numbers so these micro swimmers are swimming in this very low Reynolds          
1:03:19          
number regime and so it's not a turbulent          
1:03:26          
regime and so we're modeling sort of the way that they manage those flows their          
1:03:32          
orientation Dynamics and so forth related to that then is chemo          
1:03:38          
sensation and chemotaxis so a threes sphere swimmer          
1:03:43          
that exhibits chemotaxis and chemo reception and therefore directional Behavior our second example this was for          
1:03:50          
March 21 2022 and this was in a feature called mechanical program          
1:03:57          
so we had a number of papers in this collection including this one here which          
1:04:03          
talked about a a pattern forming cortical circuit based on row FAA and          
1:04:09          
ect2 rga3 sl4 we also had this paper on excitable mechanics embodied in a          
1:04:16          
walking psyllium we had this paper on ciliary          
1:04:22          
flocking and emerging instabilities Ena in Collective agility in non neuromuscular          
1:04:29          
animals so this is again you know this Collective Behavior it's not always          
1:04:34          
about swarms it's kind of about organisms at very small scales uh orienting themselves uh          
1:04:43          
traveling and flows and exhibiting these kind of taxic behaviors and so this was          
1:04:50          
from the uh Manu Pros group at Stanford I remember that we had number of papers          
1:04:56          
from that group this is another one mobile defects born from an energy Cascade shaping the locomotive behavior          
1:05:03          
of a headless animal so again your organisms don't have to have a brain but          
1:05:08          
they have to have that chemical signaling ability or they have to have some sort of light signaling ability the          
1:05:13          
ability to pick up these s of Radiance and so          
1:05:20          
forth and this one is the swimming riometer self-propulsion or freely suspended swim are enabled by viscal          
1:05:26          
elastic normal stresses so this is again his behavior where physics          
1:05:32          
dominates and we get these so this is where we have self- propulsion at low Reynolds numbers it's notoriously          
1:05:40          
restricted this is commonly known as the scallop theorem so people actually have a name for this here we present a truly          
1:05:46          
self-propelled swimmer or and torque free that will unable to swim in a neonian fluid due to the scallop theorem          
1:05:54          
so we know that newon Ian regimes swimming in L Reynolds numbers if you don't have these sort of uh abilities to          
1:06:02          
generate force or Torque and you can't swim it's kind of a problem for some of          
1:06:07          
these microorganisms these organisms that they're talking about here these          
1:06:13          
swimmers are able to propel themselves in a non- neonian fluid as a result of          
1:06:18          
fluid elasticity so they're able to sort of uh these but they have here robotic          
1:06:24          
swimmers that exploit these properties of the fluid that they're in to swim and          
1:06:30          
so these robotic swimmers have a head sphere and a tail sphere so they're two spheres with a polarity it's kind of          
1:06:37          
like a very small two cell embryo the swimming speed is shown to have reasonable agreement with a          
1:06:43          
microhydrodynamic asymptotic theory and numerical simulations so this is          
1:06:49          
Hardcore um this is hardcore          
1:06:58          
hydrodynamics so the third feature is a soft Collective matter feature for March          
1:07:04          
7 2022 and again we have two papers here we actually we have a paper on a          
1:07:10          
nematode called the TU atric sayet so these are synchronized oscillations of          
1:07:16          
these swarms if you look at the cover of soft matter up for that month this is these          
1:07:23          
are these neod and they're kind of behaving in this Collective          
1:07:29          
way and this other paper Collective motion of cells model is ring polymers          
1:07:34          
so you know unlike nematodes these are polymers these are not you know they          
1:07:40          
don't they don't have a brain but they can be okay in this paper Collective motion          
1:07:47          
of cells modeled as ring polymers so in this case we have cells          
1:07:52          
and we can model them as these kind of shaped uh polymer structures and so the first          
1:07:59          
thing I like to do is go to the Wikipedia page for swarmers so this is a large concept or          
1:08:05          
sort of a unifying concept called swarm uh what I've shown you are          
1:08:11          
examples of the Swarm relator concept and we'll talk about sort of a seed paper that was written by Steven sturat          
1:08:18          
and colleagues and another paper on the topic as well uh this is uh          
1:08:26          
basically they Define swarm lators as generalizations of phase oscillators that swarm around in space and          
1:08:33          
synchronize in time so this is where we have the swarming Behavior Collective behavior that get synchronized in time          
1:08:40          
so a classic example of this are fireflies they synchronize their flashing over time they may exist in          
1:08:48          
sort of the same area patch of of your lawn and they basically will uh light up          
1:08:55          
their Lucifer a Sac to Signal other uh fireflies and so they can synchronize          
1:09:03          
those uh over time and so we can use a number of computational models physics          
1:09:09          
models to model this and we'll see in a bit what those are camoto oscillators          
1:09:15          
are a famous one but there are others as well so these kind of swarm lator models          
1:09:22          
were introduced uh in a number of diverse real world systems that both sink and          
1:09:29          
swarm such as vinegar eels magnetic domain walls and Japanese tree frogs so          
1:09:35          
swarm lators can be both organismal and non- organismal as long as they exhibit          
1:09:41          
these two properties more formally they are dynamical units with spatial degrees of freedom as as well as internal          
1:09:48          
degrees of freedom where the Dynamics are coupled and so these are some real world examples this is a graph that kind          
1:09:55          
of shows kind of the different domains where these formulators exist and the          
1:10:02          
number of particles involved so as we go up on this graph there are more particles per swarm          
1:10:08          
lator uh and then we have different domains biology chemistry physics and          
1:10:15          
Engineering so in biology we have a lot of swarmers as we might expect we have          
1:10:20          
Japanese tree frogs magnetotactic bacteria so these are the you know these          
1:10:26          
are organisms that exhibit these taxes or these movement towards some sort of source in this case mag magnetic          
1:10:34          
sources we have migratory cells cells that move see in development they move from one location to          
1:10:41          
another embryonic cells as well so we can use this to model embryogenesis or          
1:10:46          
think about embryogenesis in this way and then of course micro swimmer such as          
1:10:51          
sperm or vinegar eels so again these are very tiny uh units orus in this case          
1:10:58          
cells uh or you know whatever that can swim in a fluid and so they have to          
1:11:05          
stick together in that fluid and sperm are a great example of that because they have to have this sort of uh both          
1:11:14          
synchronization and the swarming ability chemistry then we have chemical          
1:11:20          
pumps and chemical micr Motors in physics we have magnetic domain walls you or like electromagnetic          
1:11:28          
colloids so these are o Janis particles which we talked about earlier in the meeting and quinky          
1:11:35          
rulers um and then in engineering we have robot swarms so these are Rovers or          
1:11:40          
drones and so I know a lot of people are doing drone engineering nowadays and they're doing they're trying to figure          
1:11:46          
out different ways to build you know Collective behaviors into these uh          
1:11:51          
collectives of drones so you have a bunch of drones that go out and they might do something like a search and          
1:11:56          
rescue mission or they might do something like um you know an attack          
1:12:02          
pattern and they have to have this sort of both sinking and swarming ability so          
1:12:08          
this is uh you know it's sort of this diverse set of systems that's kind of being brought together into this under          
1:12:15          
this topic and so if we look quickly at the two-dimensional sorator model we          
1:12:20          
have uh this is a model in two Dimensions so in its generic form we          
1:12:26          
have these equations we have the spatial Dynamics com combining pairwise uh so we have the          
1:12:34          
spatial Dynamics characterized as a set of par wise interactions H which produce swarming          
1:12:40          
and aggregation so we have a bunch of agents in space they have pairwise interactions          
1:12:45          
their pairwise interactions have to be coordinated to get sink but they also          
1:12:51          
have to be coordinated in space to get swarming so we know a lot from different          
1:12:56          
types of collective Behavior models that they can't be too far apart they can't be too close together or sometimes they          
1:13:03          
need to be close together they send these signals and they know the location of their neighbors they do this in a          
1:13:10          
pairwise fashion and then that propagates across the Swarm or the flock          
1:13:15          
and so we can actually use these pawise interactions in a number of ways to get these kind of          
1:13:21          
behaviors the novelty is the is the          
1:13:34          
the novelty of the attraction is modified by a phase term F so this term up here F uh thus the aggregation          
1:13:43          
becomes phase dependent so in other words you have the sort of novelty aspect that gets uh put into this          
1:13:50          
equation as well likewise the phase Dynamics contain a sync term G sub sync          
1:13:55          
which is here and again we have these these subtractive relationships Modified          
1:14:01          
by a spatial term so the synchronization becomes position dependent so it's this difference between these two I and J and          
1:14:09          
so you have these pairwise interactions that we can look at in short the Swarm lators model the          
1:14:16          
Swarm lators model the interaction between self- synchronization and self assembly in          
1:14:23          
space so we have this two-dimensional model and we can extend it to the three-dimensional case as well uh the          
1:14:30          
two-dimensional case is the easiest way to look at it and we'll see in a minute what those two dimensional cases look          
1:14:35          
like we can expand those to three there are two parameters J and K uh J controls          
1:14:42          
the strength of the phase Bas attraction repulsion so there's this attraction repulsion Dynamic and then K describes          
1:14:49          
the phase coupling strength so you have attraction repulsion and then you have a          
1:14:54          
phase cou the above can be considered as a blending of the aggregation model          
1:15:00          
introduced from biological swarming so in these equations we have J and K they          
1:15:05          
represent different things and then we have this blending of the aggregation model we go to reference          
1:15:13          
23 that's this uh by Chad topaz and Andrew bernoff non-local aggregation          
1:15:19          
models a primer Of Swarm equilibrium this is in cyan review that must but that might be a nice          
1:15:25          
uh paper to review so in terms of the phenomenology this is what the formulator States look like so we have a          
1:15:31          
stat a static sync state so if we look at two Dimensions we have the static synchronization State we have the static          
1:15:39          
asynchronization state so these things are all synchronized these things are asynchronized but they're both          
1:15:46          
static then third example is static phase wave so you have this ring that          
1:15:52          
where we have these different phases and we have this standing wave that kind of moves around the uh          
1:15:59          
toroid uh then we have the spenter phase wave so we have this phase wave around the toid but they're split into groups          
1:16:06          
so they're independent phases and they're discontinuous and then we have the          
1:16:11          
active phase wave where we have this moving it's no longer static it's moving around so we have the static cases we          
1:16:18          
have the splintered case which is discontinuous and then we have the active case which is continuous so          
1:16:24          
there's a rotational aspect around a c a central point so you can think of fish Milling          
1:16:32          
or fish Mill around a central point as an active phase wave so in an active phase wave swarm lators running a space          
1:16:39          
phase Vortex with half running clockwise and the remaining half running counterclockwise so there's actually two          
1:16:46          
phases of motion within this phase wave so we can think of this in terms of order parameters and the way they do          
1:16:52          
these order parameter plots is we have k versus the uh degree of order so we have          
1:16:58          
this basically these two different types these three regimes we have the static          
1:17:05          
phase wave actually Four regimes okay and so we have four regimes          
1:17:10          
here we have the static phase wave the splintered phase wave the active phase wave and the static asynchronous phase          
1:17:18          
wave so we have gamma and T minus K so we have gamma here this function          
1:17:25          
which is active during the active phase wave and summon the static asynchronous          
1:17:30          
and then we have this black function that is active in the splintered phase          
1:17:36          
wave decreases during the active phase wave and then goes to Extinction and the          
1:17:41          
static asynchronous so all of these represent these different states that I just showed you but this is these are          
1:17:47          
sort of the order parameters was uh so there are several unresolved          
1:17:53          
puzzles and open questions related to swarm lators we have a number of different phase transitions that we want          
1:18:00          
to characterize the first is what they call melting point which is K subm of J          
1:18:05          
what is the value of this parameter at which the static async State melts into the active phase wave state so we have          
1:18:12          
this static async state in the active phase wave state we have this boundary and the idea is where do we find the          
1:18:19          
line between those two things or where's the transition and it's not a sharp phase transition so that's why they're          
1:18:25          
asking this question as you can see from this graph it's kind of just melts into          
1:18:31          
another state so this is one question that we have where do we get where do we get these boundaries sometimes we get          
1:18:37          
short phase Transitions and it's very obvious other times we get situations like this where it's not quite obvious          
1:18:44          
where that point is and so this is what we're trying to find the other is a splitting point for          
1:18:51          
case of SJ and that's what is the splitting point at which which the active phase wave spills into the          
1:18:56          
splintered phase wave so again this is the same question but only for this side          
1:19:02          
where again you don't have the well you have a sharp phase transition here but not here and so it's hard to know          
1:19:08          
exactly what that signature is and we have rainbow rainbow order          
1:19:14          
parameters and so the question here is can you derive an expression from the super critical branch of s for the fixed          
1:19:22          
J and active phase wave splintered phase w wave States and then and see what determines          
1:19:28          
the number of clusters formed in the splintered phase wave so in this case we have maybe clusters like we we saw up in          
1:19:36          
the number of states here we have the splintered phase wave how many clusters do you have how many discontinuous          
1:19:43          
discrete states do you have here so we can actually model this in one dimension as well so we have this one-dimensional          
1:19:49          
swarm lator models uh this is where the Swarm lators are depicted as dots on          
1:19:55          
this plane so we have this one-dimensional models we actually have          
1:20:00          
so we have the asynchronous case where there's no onedimensional pattern we have the phase wave state          
1:20:07          
where these patterns are kind of oriented diagonally plus the onedimensional          
1:20:12          
aspect we have the mixed where we have these sort of discontinuous patches along this          
1:20:19          
orientation and then the synchronized where they're discontinuous but they're very tightly organized          
1:20:26          
so those are those are what we have here for this uh onedimensional swarm lator          
1:20:32          
model swarm relators are depicted this dots in this plane and then we have to pick out the onedimensional aspect so          
1:20:40          
this simple sorator model is where we can restrict spatial motion to a one dimensional ring and according to these          
1:20:49          
equations and we get these different states and and so then that gives us uh          
1:20:57          
sort of a door into modeling this with different types of models so we can actually use the one-dimensional Swarm          
1:21:04          
relator model and we can actually get some uh information out of this we can          
1:21:09          
also use a Coto model Which models each uh individual organism or individual          
1:21:16          
agent as an oscillator and those oscillators have to synchronize and so this is for a moto          
1:21:22          
model in the one-dimensional Swarm model and it just depends on you know what          
1:21:27          
you're trying to do you can look at Phase coupling strength the coromoto model you can use a onedimensional swarm          
1:21:33          
lator model and it has its own          
1:21:39          
advantages so the other thing I'd like to talk about is a complexity explorables model of swarm          
1:21:44          
lators this is swarm lators oscillators at sync and swarm patterns that emerge          
1:21:50          
when Collective motion and synchronization and tangle so this is where we have this entanglement of          
1:21:56          
collective motion and synchronization so this is a demo you know we can this is actually from this          
1:22:02          
paper byke Hong and stats oscillators at sink and swarm this is from nature          
1:22:08          
Communications and we'll see this in a minute it may capture effects observed in biological systems such as          
1:22:15          
chemotactic microorganisms or bacterial biofilms and so these are some YouTube          
1:22:21          
videos here of swarmers being real ized as groups of little robots and flocks of          
1:22:27          
drones we can put these into practice uh so this is a simulation here          
1:22:34          
that shows us formulator we have the synchronization strength here which we can play with and we have like attracts          
1:22:40          
life strength which is this homophily so we can set that maybe low or          
1:22:46          
high and we have these different I don't know what these are these are visualizations I guess makes me dizzy          
1:22:52          
fractions rainbow ring dancing circus uh let's TR solar convection and          
1:22:59          
then these are some advanced settings so why don't we just do this and see what happens play with it a little bit so          
1:23:05          
this is the first example this is synchronization strength very high the homop Philly is about average so you see          
1:23:12          
that they're starting to sort in this ring or in this sort of spherical thing it's not a ring really          
1:23:19          
yet I can see the different states so between states here this is          
1:23:27          
the solar convection visualization if we do makes me dizzy and I'm          
1:23:33          
curious this is where they kind of migrate in and out of the central cluster so it's interesting how they're          
1:23:40          
kind of you're able to see different types of patterns here where different          
1:23:47          
states are sort of migrating around and providing different shapes          
1:23:55          
what about fractions what does that look like that's yeah now it's starting to          
1:24:01          
form this annuus it's yeah there we go we're          
1:24:07          
getting this annuus which is actually we saw in the demos where we have these different now          
1:24:13          
we're starting to get individual clusters here as you can          
1:24:20          
see so if we go back up to this example here it's like a splintered phase          
1:24:27          
wave and that's where it's converging so that's synchronization strength of average like a homophilia of          
1:24:34          
high let's do this we'll start this over reset          
1:24:42          
it and then uh we'll do a synchronization strength very low and we          
1:24:47          
fil of average we'll do fractions and now it's again this          
1:24:58          
sphere the states are sorting you see patterns in there it's kind of          
1:25:08          
interesting and so now it's kind of sitting there it's just you know and          
1:25:13          
then let's see if we do like solar convection again let's go back to that okay now we're just getting a more          
1:25:21          
rapid sort of uh sorting and uh bringing us moving around a          
1:25:27          
little bit more see there's not as much variation in terms of the shape as there was before so this is interesting          
1:25:33          
synchronization strength again is very high homophilia is about average so now          
1:25:38          
we're favoring sort of synchronization of behavior over sorting into different states so naturally we would see maybe          
1:25:46          
something more like this static sync State all right so that's the simulation          
1:25:52          
and then this is how it works here we have a n equals 500 swarmers so we can't          
1:25:58          
vary the number of swarm lators in the simulation it just runs from there we can uh vary the other things uh the          
1:26:05          
state of the formulator N is defined by three variables the internal phase and          
1:26:11          
two positional variables X and Y because we're in this two- dimensional regime the phase is depicted by a color          
1:26:18          
of a continuous rainbow color wheel so you know that's where we're getting this pulsing of color          
1:26:24          
initially the Swarm lator phase variables random all of them plays randomly in the plane and Aller rest so          
1:26:31          
they all start at sort of a resting state an initial condition and then you          
1:26:36          
know they you apply the equations of motion and you know they get this          
1:26:43          
simulation so the movements are subject or the formulators or in terms of movement are subject to two opposing          
1:26:49          
forces we have short range repulsion which is where again we have these pawise relationships between swor lators          
1:26:57          
we get this difference and the difference determines whether we see rep pulon or whether we see attraction so          
1:27:05          
you know this is where this homophilia comes into play we can set this so that it favors maybe attraction it favors          
1:27:12          
repulsion but we do have these two opposing forces and so they get balanced out in different ways so the first is a          
1:27:19          
short range repulsion where two swarm relaters come too close if they come too          
1:27:24          
a repulsive Force dominates and pushes them apart so this allows them to not bump into one another but it also          
1:27:31          
results in the moving away have a tenden having a tendency to move away this force is negligible and swarm          
1:27:38          
relators are far apart obviously because there's no reason to push them apart additionally any two swarm lators          
1:27:45          
experience a force that pulls them to get towards one another this magnitude of the attractive force does not          
1:27:51          
decrease with distance which is why it's a long range attractive Force the clue          
1:27:56          
is that this attractive force between two swaters say n and M depend on their          
1:28:01          
phase difference or this difference between M and when like attracts like parameter J is positive this is the Sol          
1:28:08          
Philly here if it's positive in this direction a similarity in Phase enhances          
1:28:14          
the attractive Force when this parameter is negative hilus down here the          
1:28:20          
formulators are more attracted to others of opposite phase so these these colors          
1:28:25          
you get these either you get these clusters of light type or you get these          
1:28:30          
sort of regions of variation in          
1:28:36          
type and then of course we have our synchronization where there's the culator phases Advance at a constant          
1:28:42          
phase velocity or frequency like an internal clock so we can you know map          
1:28:47          
this in biological systems to like clocks like you know uh          
1:28:54          
division clocks or other types of uh s or different types of          
1:29:01          
oscillating uh oscillating mechanisms in biology additionally a swarm lator phase          
1:29:07          
also changes as a function of the phases of other swarm lators so when the synchronization parameter K is the posit          
1:29:14          
is positive the phase difference of m&n two between two swarm lators N&M this          
1:29:20          
decreases as they tend to synchronize so this phase difference say they synchronize the phase difference          
1:29:26          
decreases so basically you get instead of having an anti-phase U sine wave you get an          
1:29:33          
inphase sign wave and when they become desynchronized the opposite is true you          
1:29:38          
go from a synchronized sign wave to anti- synchronize sign waves this type of phase coupling          
1:29:46          
coupled oscillation is also explored the explor was a ride my curl motocycle and          
1:29:52          
Janice Bunch so this is the curl Moto oscillator ride my C          
1:29:58          
motocycle this one here this is looks interesting it kind of rotates around          
1:30:05          
like a a cycle or a motor motorcycle and it's running around it's it's you know          
1:30:11          
you can set it so that it synchronizes set of oscillators and then          
1:30:16          
this Janis bunch and we talked about Janice particles earlier in the meeting again          
1:30:23          
this is where the oscillator Has Two Faces each corresponding to a distinct          
1:30:28          
internal phase area so again this is where we have these you know these two phases and          
1:30:34          
they're kind of moving around in this sphere bouncing around changing size and          
1:30:40          
color so it's lots of fun um and so yeah you can run through this          
1:30:47          
expl uh complexity explorable it's very fun to do now let's get to the papers so          
1:30:52          
there's this first paper here that is from o'keef Hong and          
1:30:58          
stroat this is oscillators that sink and swim so this is sort of the seed paper          
1:31:03          
for this so this this this is one of the F first papers that really kind of um          
1:31:09          
you know synthesized a lot of this area in terms of a review          
1:31:15          
so Stephen stats has been talking about these kind of oscillators for many years          
1:31:20          
and so but this is this idea of a swarm lator is is really um a newer idea so          
1:31:27          
synchronization occurs in many natural and technological systems cardiac pacemaker sells to coup lasers and we          
1:31:34          
can see this and this is sort of the power of the heart I guess as it were is          
1:31:40          
that the cardiac pacemakers are synchronized but they also behave collectively um and then you of course          
1:31:47          
with a couple lasers is the same thing in the synchronized State the individual cells or lasers coordinate the timing of          
1:31:53          
the ulations but they do not move through space so there's this temporal aspect but not the spatial aspect a          
1:32:00          
complimentary form of self organization occurs among swarming insects focking birds or schooling fish now the          
1:32:07          
individuals move through space but with without conspicuously altering their internal States so this is where they're          
1:32:13          
moving around but they're not they're all kind of in the same state nominally they're just trying to coordinate their          
1:32:19          
movements and so this is where you the very classic models voids where you're just simply modeling the          
1:32:26          
interactions between individual agents you're not worried about their internal state or any other type of State here we          
1:32:34          
explore systems in which both synchronization and swarming occur together so we have these models like          
1:32:40          
cardiac pacemakers modeled with flocking birds and so we combine those two we          
1:32:45          
take the interactions but we also take the internal State specifically okay uh          
1:32:52          
specifically we consider oscillations where phase Dynamics and spatial Dynamics are coupled we call these swarm          
1:32:58          
lators highlight their dual character so this is the kind of the linkage to the Janis particles uh you have these two          
1:33:06          
different characters of the Swarm a case study of generalized kuramoto model          
1:33:13          
predicts five Collective States as possible long-term Modes of organization so that's what we're talking about in          
1:33:18          
the Wikipedia article that those there these five different modes are long          
1:33:24          
Modes of organization we were converging to the complexity Explorer in this case          
1:33:29          
these states may be observable in groups of sperm Japanese tree frogs codal suspensions of magnetic particles and          
1:33:36          
other biological and physical systems in which self assembly and synchronization interact we saw that graph of the          
1:33:44          
different types of systems uh          
1:33:51          
earlier the second paper and is the last thing I'll talk about today uh this is          
1:33:57          
Dynamics Of Swarm lators a pedagogical review uh this was in          
1:34:02          
2022 in uh the his European physics letters Journal          
1:34:14          
um yes this is in the EPO this is actually um this is also introducing          
1:34:21          
swarm lers um swarm lators have emerged as a new paradigm for dynamical          
1:34:27          
Collective behavior of multi-agent systems due to the interplay of synchronization and swarming that they          
1:34:33          
inherently incorporate so this is getting into this multi-agent systems modeling and you know this is an          
1:34:39          
interesting area not just from the standpoint of uh of uh Collective          
1:34:46          
behavior and uh self-organization but also from the standpoint of coordinating          
1:34:53          
agents in something like uh reinforcement learning and so we've been          
1:34:58          
doing in the orthogonal lab we've been talking recently about multi-agent reinforcement learning and how you know          
1:35:06          
you can model that different ways using different policies so this is a nice sort of rejoiner to that work and          
1:35:13          
thinking about this in different ways and how this can be implemented and how it can be you know explored we have this          
1:35:20          
uh dynamical Collective behavior of multi-agent systems there's a interplay of synchronization and swarming and          
1:35:26          
their Dynamics have been explored with different coupling topologies so this is what we were talking about earlier with          
1:35:32          
these coupling topologies where we have these phases that we can extract these          
1:35:37          
uh these Global phases interaction functions external forcing noise          
1:35:44          
competitive interaction and from other view important viewpoints so there are a lot of things that you can explore uh          
1:35:51          
they talk about in the paper uh uh these interaction functions external forcing we didn't actually look at the          
1:35:58          
perturbation uh button on the complexity explorable there's a perturbation button          
1:36:04          
in the simulation here this perturb which I guess just means you kind of          
1:36:10          
move it around you kind of push them in different directions so you disrupt if          
1:36:15          
if this were to converge to one of these annui uh you could uh break apart that          
1:36:23          
annual and reconverge the simulation which is interesting because it can give you different          
1:36:29          
results um so we have this these different ways you can explore once you          
1:36:34          
have this basic model then you can explore the Dynamics quite a bit and you can there are a lot of interesting          
1:36:39          
things going on here there's also noise of course we can introduce uh you know          
1:36:45          
some sort of stochastic mechanism or set of stochastic mechanisms and sometimes noise can help synchronize the systems          
1:36:52          
as well so it's not just always disruptive um and then we can have competitive interactions where we          
1:36:57          
actually have like strategies not just strategies or S of sort of you know          
1:37:03          
cognition some type so there or you know just strategy making and things like          
1:37:09          
that so it's just really interesting stuff that you can do here here we take a systematic approach and review the          
1:37:15          
collective Dynamics Of Swarm lators analytically and numerically long-term states of position          
1:37:21          
aggregation face synchronization are revealed in this perspective with some future problems so this really goes          
1:37:28          
through a lot of stuff here goes through some models of swarms as bidirectional          
1:37:33          
the bidirectional interplay between the spatial and phase dynamics of the Swarm lators draing to sort of model uh          
1:37:40          
interparticle collisions and trying to take this into account we have this KJ          
1:37:45          
parameter region look we're looking at it a little bit different way than uh the Wikipedia article this is where we          
1:37:53          
have versus K and we have these different stable States here active          
1:37:58          
phase wave splintered phase wave static phase wave static sync and static async          
1:38:04          
in the relative position in this phase space so we can say for low K and high negative or for high negative K and low          
1:38:13          
positive J we have the static async phase we have the static sync phase for all positive K below          
1:38:20          
0.6 the static phase waves kind of higher J and maybe low positive K          
1:38:27          
splintered phase wave is low negative K and high positive J and active phase          
1:38:33          
wave is this other region here this leftover region in the positive J so          
1:38:40          
this is uh you know we can break these states down into this phase base and we          
1:38:45          
can you know think about this in terms of homophile so or positive J like          
1:38:51          
attracts like which obvious ly if we want to swarm we have to have some sort of homophile at some level we want to          
1:38:58          
sometimes have uh repulsion but we don't want to do this in the absence of          
1:39:03          
Attraction so this you know these are we can think of the phase base in this way          
1:39:09          
um and we can kind of figure out where these states are and so here we can look          
1:39:16          
at the transitions of States um as a function of force amplitude so this is f          
1:39:22          
is force amplitud ude where we can actually calculate sort of how these          
1:39:27          
transitions happen according to a single parameter so they come to the conclusion that theoretical analyses have revealed          
1:39:34          
that under certain assumptions such systems possess some conserved qu quantities and finite time collision          
1:39:40          
avoidance can be assured the long-term states of these systems have been analyzed numerically and theoretically          
1:39:46          
under Global interaction addition of external forcing local interaction and          
1:39:51          
competitive competitiveness and phase coupling with both static and time varing coupling          
1:39:57          
topologies and so more studies like oscillatory Behavior with repulsive short range interaction active phase          
1:40:04          
wave with attra attractive phase coupling Dynamics Center stochastic coupling in memory and mean field limit          
1:40:11          
have enriched this field which we mention here and we're unable to discuss in our main text um and then finally we          
1:40:18          
talk about some of these things that we need to explore uh swarm ators with endowed          
1:40:24          
orientation can reveal new Collective states where their Sorrowing properties include both aggregation and          
1:40:30          
orientation there these three exponents alpha beta and gamma that determine the          
1:40:36          
ASM totic States the role of these states and how they come to be is not fully studied yet          
1:40:43          
which demands more attention so as you tune these different parameters you know they produce these stable States and we          
1:40:51          
don't really know why that is yet a new but impactful direction of          
1:40:56          
research would be to consider non-par wise interactions among the units where higher order interactions takes over and          
1:41:02          
that's citation 53 so we have 53 down here this is from the journal uh Journal          
1:41:07          
of Royal Society interface from 2022 I don't have the title that's the          
1:41:14          
citation Maji at all so this is an interesting thing          
1:41:20          
because you know we think in terms of these paral interactions but at the global level we also have to think about modeling that it's very          
1:41:27          
sometimes it's separate from these local interactions and so the stabil stability          
1:41:34          
properties of active states of the 2D swarm later model remain one of the aspects in which demand sincere          
1:41:40          
attention looking at the difficulty analizing the 2D model one can ask we          
1:41:45          
Model A solvable system for the SM lators so maybe it's not a solvable system maybe it's something we can look          
1:41:51          
at in sio in a in a simulation and drive insights from but we may not be able to          
1:41:58          
actually analyze all the interactions we can use 1D models to get          
1:42:03          
there but you know we that's not the 2D model and it's certainly not the 3D          
1:42:08          
model and that's where we want to get so that's all I have to talk about with          
1:42:14          
respect to formulators I hope you found that interesting and I hope you learn something
